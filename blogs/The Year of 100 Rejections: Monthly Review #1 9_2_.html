<p>Month 1 of the challenge is complete!</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re a new reader, see<em> <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/100-rejections/">The Year 100 Rejections</a>&#xA0;</em>for details. Put simply: In order to teach myself how to write fiction, I&#x2019;m writing short stories, submitting them to pro / semi-pro magazines, and collecting rejections.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s a chart of the words I wrote this month:</p>

<p>Some more data:</p>
<ul>
<li>This month, I wrote 31,791 words, or 127 pages of fiction.</li>
<li>On average, that&#x2019;s 963 words&#x2014;or 3.85 pages&#x2014;per day.</li>
<li>I started 22 stories but only&#xA0;finished 3 of them.</li>
<li>I submitted the finished stories a total of 6 times.</li>
<li>Of those 6 submissions, I received 3 rejections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress on my goal : <strong>3/100 Rejections</strong></p>
<p>It looks like I&#x2019;m behind schedule (I need 8-9 rejections a month to meet my 100 rejection goal), but this probably isn&#x2019;t the case. The more stories I complete, the more stories I&#x2019;ll be able to submit. This means that most of my rejections should come from Month 6 to Month 12.</p>
<p>For the rest of this review, I&#x2019;ll be reflecting on (1) my goals for the past month, (2) what went well, (3) what went poorly, (4) and my goals for February.</p>
<h2><strong>Overview of Month 1: Monthly, Weekly and Daily Goals</strong></h2>
<p>My main goal for January was to get a&#xA0;<em>feel</em> for fiction writing.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t like to set many goals at the beginning of a learning project because there&#x2019;s so little information. As a beginner, I didn&#x2019;t know how difficult writing would be, what my strengths or weaknesses were, how I&#x2019;d ration my time, etc.</p>
<p>So, my goals for January were purposely vague:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn as much as possible about the craft of fiction.</strong></li>
<li><b>Try to finish a short story a week</b></li>
</ul>
<p>To help make this happen, I broke up these monthly goals into weekly goals and daily goals.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Goals</strong></p>
<p>Write a short story a week and submit it to a pro or semi-pro magazine by end of day on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Goals</strong></p>
<p>I also broke down weekly and monthly goals into daily goals.</p>
<p>My daily goals for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Open <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/writer/">Cold Turkey Writer</a></b> &#x2013; This is an app that will not close until you meet your required word goal for the day. I set my word goal based on how I felt that day. This worked well&#x2014;I averaged 900+ words a day this month.</li>
<li><strong>Write one comment on an amateur short story&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; Bad stories teach you what&#xA0;<em>not</em> to do. Also, by contrasting good stories with the bad, start to see what the pros are doing differently.</li>
<li><strong>Write one comment on a professional short story&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; Read stories and try to figure out why the author chose to use setting, plot, dialogue, theme, etc. in the way he or she did. Also try to comment on why the author&#xA0;<em>didn&#x2019;t</em> do certain things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how small the goals are. I tried to make them so that I could finish them in 2 minutes or less. That way, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to make any excuses.</p>
<p>On most days, I did far more than the &#x201C;minimum&#x201D; my daily goals asked for.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<h2>What Went Well?</h2>
<p>Overall, I&#x2019;m satisfied with my results this month. The best part about being a beginner again is that progress comes so easily. I can just&#xA0;<em>look</em> at a published story and I feel myself absorbing lessons from it.</p>
<p>Some things that went well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I learned something everyday&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; Writing fiction is still new enough to me that I&#x2019;m learning new things every day. Plus, although none of my stories have been published yet, I got a lot of positive (and good critical) feedback. One editor for a pro magazine even gave me a personalized rejection with edits and suggested revisions.</li>
<li><strong>Coming up with ideas&#xA0;</strong><strong>was easy&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; I&#x2019;ve had no problem coming up with interesting ideas that also sound fun to write. I started 22 stories and have list with dozens of &#x201C;idea fragments&#x201D; that might someday turn into stories.</li>
<li><strong>I was consistent&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; So far, writing daily has been no problem. The only days I missed were days where extraneous circumstances&#x2014;sudden family excursions, international travel&#x2014;got in the way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Went Poorly?</h2>
<p>Although the month went well, there were (and always will be) many things I could have done better. The chief disappointment for me was that I didn&#x2019;t finish as many stories as I wanted to.</p>
<p>Some things that went poorly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>I wrote too much &#x2013;&#xA0;</strong></strong>The problem with setting aggressive word count goals (on many days, I set &#x2018;1000 words&#x2019; as my goal in <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/writer/">Cold Turkey</a>) is that there is an incentive for me to pump out rough drafts instead of going through the painstaking process of editing stories. As a result, I started 20+ stories but only finished 3 of them. To fix this, I&#x2019;m going to try to write&#xA0;<em>fewer</em> words a day and spend more time on revision.</li>
<li><strong>I didn&#x2019;t do enough revising &#x2013;&#xA0;</strong>As mentioned above, I tried to write as many words as I could this month (which makes pretty graphs). The consequence of this was that I often felt like writing new drafts instead of revising old ones. For Month 2, I want to schedule time to edit stories each day.</li>
<li><strong>I succumbed to perfectionism &#x2013;&#xA0;</strong>I keep forgetting that the goal of this project is to&#xA0;<em>get rejected</em>. My fear that my stories aren&#x2019;t good enough might be another reason I didn&#x2019;t finish as many stories as I would have liked. For Month 2, I might make a story a terrible&#xA0;on purpose just to get over the my fear of looking stupid.</li>
<li><strong>I didn&#x2019;t read enough fiction stories&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013;&#xA0;I went through 5-10 &#x201C;how to&#x201D; books on the craft of fiction this month. After the first few, they all start to sound the same. Next month, I want to spend less of my reading time on &#x201C;how to&#x201D; books and more time on real stories instead.</li>
<li><strong>Amateur stories were frustrating to read &#x2013;&#xA0;</strong>At first,&#xA0;critiquing amateur stories helped me learn what&#xA0;<em>not</em> to do when I write. But it felt like these insights were subject to diminishing returns: after the first two weeks of January, I didn&#x2019;t feel like I was learning from a lot of the amateur stories I read. The solution, I think, is to find amateur stories of better quality (perhaps by volunteering to read submissions for a popular fiction magazine).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals For Next Month</h2>
<p>With the above reflections in mind, here are my goals for Month 2.</p>
<p>My biggest weaknesses from last month were perfectionism and my inability to finish stories I started. The new weekly and daily goals, I hope, will help combat this.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Goals (Unchanged)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finish one short story a week</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daily Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open an old draft and revise for 2 minutes</strong> &#x2013; This is to help guarantee I do some sort of editing everyday</li>
<li><b>Open <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/writer/">Cold Turkey Writer</a>&#xA0;(but write less)</b>&#xA0;&#x2013; I set goals of ~1000 words for many days last month. To teach myself to write less (and edit more), I will try to set lower word goals (~500) this month.</li>
<li><strong>Write one comment on an amateur short story&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; Same as last month, but I want to find amateur stories of higher quality.</li>
<li><strong>Write one comment on a professional short story&#xA0;</strong>&#x2013; Same as last month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, at least once, I&#x2019;d like to purposely write a bad story and send it out for submissions.</p>
<p>See you next month,<br>
Charles</p>
