					<p>However adventurous &#x201C;traveling the world&#x201D; may seem, my days generally&#xA0;<em>aren&#x2019;t</em> filled with adventure. I&#x2019;m a firm believer that success comes from the daily grind of not-so-sexy things done over and over for weeks, months and years.</p>
<p>Most people don&#x2019;t know what their day will look like. Which is fine, if you&#x2019;re chasing average results. </p>
<p>My eventual goal is 4-6 hours of movement-related training and 4-6 hours of intense, creative, focused work on a daily basis. What I&#x2019;ve been doing is (a) creating a model day and (b) scaling up intensity as my body adjusts.</p>
<p>The current goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average 4 hours of focused work per day.</li>
<li>Physical training for 3 hours per day.</li>
<li>Reduce garbage time (time spent on net negative activities) to less than 30m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I hit a 70%+ success rate on the above, I can scale up to more hours.</p>
<p>Note that this isn&#x2019;t just a workaholic grind, grind, grind. I do this because I love the process. I want each activity to be driving me closer to my personal goals (physical, social and financial freedom). At the end of every day, I&#x2019;m always striving to be able to genuinely say, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing I&#x2019;d rather have done. There&#x2019;s no place I&#x2019;d rather have been.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#x2019;s what my days have been looking like:</p>
<p><strong>Morning Ritual (</strong>~15m)</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up. Generally around 7-8am. Toilet. Meditation in the form of breathing exercises. Complete joint maintenance work.</li>
<li>Tea. Lately I&#x2019;ve been experimenting with a morning cocktail of matcha tea, lime, and coconut oil. </li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Short Movement Block</strong>(~45m)</p>
<ul>
<li>Lately this has been (1) handstand training and (2) flexibility work.</li>
<li>Follow with breakfast (high protein, no carbs) and standard AM hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Work Block I (</strong>90-120m<strong>)</strong><br>First block of focused work and also the time of day when I am most productive. I try to my &#x201C;most important task&#x201D; here. These are high-priority, goal-oriented tasks that I most want to get done for the day.</p>
<p>Lately, this has been:</p>
<ul>
<li>30-60m of writing (my most important activity)</li>
<li>Freelance work for income generation</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Core Movement Block</strong> (60-120 minutes)<br>The content of this will vary depending on goals, but typically contains some sort of strength training and whatever skill I am working on.</p>
<p>Currently, this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>General strength. I alternate bent arm, straight arm and lower body days.</li>
<li>Mobility. Aiming to get the bridge, front splits and middle splits this year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Afternoon Reset</strong><br>Mental reset to recover from cognitive fatigue, refuel, and do a mental reset in the case the morning did not go well. Still experimenting, but recently I&#x2019;ve been eating a good post-workout meal and then napping for 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Afternoon Work Block</strong> (60-120m)<br>Final work block before I am &#x201C;satisfied&#x201D; and call it a day. Typically less intense than the morning session, I will do more freelance work and work on meta things for the blog.</p>
<p>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Evenings are more relaxing, focused on the &#x201C;intangibles&#x201D;&#x2014;recovery, social life, spiritual things, etc. My goal is to get most productive work done in the first ~10 hours of the day, leaving freedom for more &#x201C;irrational&#x201D; things / activities that contribute to current life satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Evening Movement Block</strong> (60-90m)<br>Some sort of relaxing, recovery-focused movement activity. Lately I&#x2019;ve been doing a lot of yoga. It&#x2019;s nice to turn the brain off for that 60-90 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Evening Unwind</strong><br>Chill with friends. Or, as the introvert I am, this is tea plus a good book on many nights. Trying to stay away from smartphone and computer.</p>
<p>Even if it isn&#x2019;t this detailed, &#xA0;give planning a &#x201C;model&#x201D; day a try in your own life. I find it is an excellent self-diagnostic for how far I stray from my own goals.</p>
