<p>One of my friends is starting a blog.</p>
<p>She&#x2019;s excited, but she doesn&#x2019;t know how to start.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a lot of myth out there about how things &#x2018;have to&#x2019; be done. You have to &#x201C;focus on SEO&#x2019; or &#x201C;guest posting&#x201D; or &#x201C;networking&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s just not true.</p>
<p>To help set her off on the right foot, I wrote an email about some first steps she can take.</p>
<p>Hope it&#x2019;s useful to you as well.</p>

<p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>Some tips to help get your blog set up.</p>
<p>The biggest danger here: getting caught up in &#x201C;fake problems&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;ll be confusing when you first set up your blog. But try not to get caught up in the details. Just choose a good hosting provider, a decent domain name, and a passable theme.</p>
<p>Then focus on writing.</p>
<p>Prove you have a readership FIRST, then worry about the blog.</p>
<p>Blogging skills in order of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding of human nature&#x2014;find what resonates with people</li>
<li>Marketing&#x2014;knowing what to put where</li>
<li>Writing ability&#x2014;expressing ideas</li>
<li>Everything else</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x2019;ll talk about why I rank writing so low later.</p>
<p>A couple tips on logistics for blogging&#x2026;</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-98719" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="just-use-wordpress">Just Use WordPress</h2>
<p>If you&#x2019;re new and not tech-savvy, just run your blog on WordPress. Hands down worth the money.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of not using WordPress when I started. It cost me a lot of time and money later to port over. Just accept the up front costs to test WordPress for your first 3-6 months. It&#x2019;s not that much money, and it&#x2019;ll save a lot of headache later (might as well learn the system you&#x2019;ll be using later while you can).</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-25192" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="get-a-hosting-provider">Get a Hosting Provider</h2>
<p>You&#x2019;ll need a server to host your WordPress site on.</p>
<p>A few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not host on WordPress.com, you give up a lot of customization to use their platform.</li>
<li>Do not use Bluehost, HostGator or Siteground. They pay a lot of money for people to advertise their stuff; the quality is bad.</li>
<li>Some good options: A Small Orange, Media Temple, Namecheap, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-33963" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="choose-a-domain-name">Choose a Domain Name</h2>
<p>Domains should be memorable and somehow related to what you are writing about. But you can be successful with a ridiculous title that makes no sense. For example&#x2026;Market Meditations.</p>
<p>Try to get a &#x201C;.com&#x201D; if you can. But it doesn&#x2019;t matter that much. Again, don&#x2019;t sweat the details. You just want to get past this stage and focus on writing.</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-42836" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="get-a-theme">Get a Theme</h2>
<p>Just get a free theme until you learn more about how you want your site set up. You can change it at any time. Again (is this the third time?), focus on readership first. Optimize later.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a lot easier to have a simple theme and add on what you want than to have a complicated theme and try to delete.</p>
<p>These sites all do extremely well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pjrvs.com/">https://pjrvs.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jamesclear.com/">http://jamesclear.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://andrewchen.co/">http://andrewchen.co/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://okdork.com/">http://okdork.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You&#x2019;ll notice that their design is simple. Don&#x2019;t get attracted by flashy scripts or fancy features&#x2014;that stuff takes away from the end goals (conversion + presenting good content).</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-48618" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="the-email-list-is-everything">The Email List is Everything</h2>
<p>There&#x2019;s a reason I treasure my newsletter so much. It&#x2019;s the lifeblood of any personal brand.</p>
<p>You do all this work&#x2014;drafting essays, editing, outreach, syndication, etc.&#x2014;in order to build a loyal following. And the loyal following starts with an email list.</p>
<p>Make it easy for people to sign up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make one of your menu options your newsletter</li>
<li>Put opt-in forms in accessible locations</li>
<li>Whenever relevant, mention your newsletter as the best way to stay in touch and provide a link</li>
</ul>
<p>Signup rates to aim for:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;1%&#x2014;not good</li>
<li>1-5%&#x2014;average</li>
<li>5-10%&#x2014;excellent</li>
<li>15%&#x2014;fantastic</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-98790" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of other things to track and worry about, but simple is best. If you find yourself lost, just ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people are coming to read my stuff?</li>
<li>What percentage of them are staying around? (By signing up for the newsletter)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answers to either of these two questions are sub-optimal, you know where you should be focusing.</p>
<p>Send me an email if you have more questions.</p>

<div id="wmd-preview-section-99061" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h1 id="some-thoughts-on-non-logistics">Some Thoughts on Non-Logistics</h1>
<p>Okay, that&#x2019;s all the logistics aside. Since I still feel like writing, a few thoughts on personal branding, writing style and target audience.</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-104352" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="audience-who-are-you-writing-for">Audience: Who are you writing for?</h2>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t know who you are writing for and what their pain points are, it&#x2019;s difficult to resonate with people.</p>
<p>For example, consider these two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group A</strong>: 20-35 year-old tech-savvy males (aka Hacker News)</li>
<li><strong>Groub B</strong>: 35-50 year-old American housewives (aka Pinterest?).</li>
</ul>
<p>If I write an article about circadian rhythms and optimizing work cycles, there&#x2019;s a high probability (50%+) that it does well for Group A. The probability of success for Group B would be much lower (&lt;1%, maybe).</p>
<p><em>Note: As a side thought, if you are goiing to be doing this kind of entreprenurial stuff, it&#x2019;s important to start assigning probabilities to outcomes like above. Hard to take risks or evaluate decisions otherwise.</em></p>
<p>It might help to draw a Venn Diagram with:</p>
<ol>
<li>What you know about</li>
<li>What you are interested in</li>
<li>What your audience is interested in</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever comes in the middle is probably a good topic to write about.</p>
<p>A helpful exercise is to envision your audience as a person (or several people) and use the image of that person to approve or reject ideas.</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-109583" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="spend-90-of-your-time-off-the-blog">Spend 90%+ of your time OFF the blog</h2>
<p>This is so, so important. Very few bloggers do this. They publish on their blog and wonder why the traffic doesn&#x2019;t come. Of course it doesn&#x2019;t come&#x2014;you didn&#x2019;t put the fruit in front of anyone.</p>
<p>Once you have a basic blog set up, I would recommend you <strong>spend 1-2 months writing solely for other platforms.</strong></p>
<p>Other platforms have audiences built in. Yours doesn&#x2019;t. The plan: put your content on other platforms, link back to your site and build a loyal following with your email list.</p>
<p>A couple platforms that don&#x2019;t require expertise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quora</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
</ul>
<p>Medium is the best out of these three. Quora is good for testing ideas and writing shorter pieces. Reddit is good for targeting specific niches, but requires more finesse.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a second reason why you should write on other platforms&#x2014;you get direct feedback on your writing. Bad writing doesn&#x2019;t get upvoted on these platforms. You get immediate feedback (often within &lt;1 hours) about whether your writing resonated with people.</p>
<p>Let me repeat.</p>
<p>Within ONE HOUR, you get direct feedback on whether your writing resonated with people.</p>
<p>That doesn&#x2019;t happen anywhere else. You&#x2019;d have to beg friends or pay an editor, and they may not be totally sincere with you.</p>
<p>You get brutal honesty FOR FREE. It&#x2019;s like getting a PhD in psychology without having to pay for it.</p>
<p>If you give people what they want, your content goes up. If you don&#x2019;t, it goes down.</p>
<p>Nothing fairer.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>To readers:</p>
<p>Are you interested more in blogging, personal branding or content promotion?</p>
<p>I can write all day about this stuff, and I&#x2019;d be happy to provide it in a more polished form if there&#x2019;s demand.</p>
