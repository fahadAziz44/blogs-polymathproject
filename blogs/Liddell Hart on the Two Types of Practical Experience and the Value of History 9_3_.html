					<blockquote><p>&#x201C;Fools say they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by other people&#x2019;s experience.&#x201D; -Bismarck</p></blockquote>
<p>Liddell Hart was one of the great military strategists and historians of the 20th century. Some rank his treatises on strategy alongside those of Sun Tzu and Carl von Clauswitz.</p>
<p>In a short volume titled&#xA0;<em><a href="http://amzn.to/2s2AzFb">Why Don&#x2019;t We Learn From History?</a></em>, Hart dispels some common myths concerning the study and value of history.</p>
<h1 id="history-for-everyone"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#history-for-everyone" name="user-content-history-for-everyone" aria-hidden="true"></a>History For Everyone</h1>
<p>Until my early twenties, I saw history as both boring and wasteful. It was filled with numbers and names and seemed so irrelevant to my everyday worries.</p>
<p>But it is a big mistake, says Hart, to see history as a specialist&#x2019;s subject meant only for liberal arts students or quack hobbyists:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;There is a too common tendency to regard history as a specialist subject&#x2014;that is the primary mistake. For, on the contrary,&#xA0;<strong>history is the essential corrective to all specialization. Viewed aright, it is the broadest of studies, embracing every aspect of life.</strong>&#xA0;It lays the foundation of education by showing how mankind repeats its errors and what those errors are.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is interesting that Hart calls history the &#x201C;foundation&#x201D; of education.</p>
<p>One way to see knowledge is to rank it by purity, beginning with the study individual atoms and particles (physics) to molecules (chemistry) to biological systems (biology) and then, finally, to individual humans (psychology) and their interactions (sociology, history, economics, etc.).</p>

<p>This way of ranking things (like any other system) is biased.&#xA0;Put in this order, subjects like history and sociology are seen as &#x201C;impure&#x201D;&#x2014;leftover pickings for students who couldn&#x2019;t pass Organic Chemistry or learn to transpose matrices.</p>
<p>Another way of seeing things though (and perhaps this is how Hart saw it) is to see the social sciences as&#xA0;<em>fundamental</em>. We&#x2014;both as individuals and as members of a group&#x2014;are humans first and bunches of atoms second.</p>
<p>In the BBC series&#xA0;<em>Sherlock</em>, Holmes quips to Watson that he doesn&#x2019;t need to know that the Earth revolves around the Sun because it is of no use in solving crime. This is an exaggeration of course, but it also seems to me that, for the ordinary person looking to live a better life, teachings from fields like economics, psychology and sociology and far more valuable than those of Linear Algebra.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>Hart says history is so valuable because it provides us with a second kind practical experience, different from what we can get in our everyday lives.</p>

<h1 id="the-two-kinds-of-experience"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#the-two-kinds-of-experience" name="user-content-the-two-kinds-of-experience" aria-hidden="true"></a>The Two Kinds of Experience</h1>
<p>Over 2000 years ago, the Greek historian Polybius wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;There are two roads to the reformation for mankind&#x2014;one through misfortunes of their own, the other through the misfortunes of others; the former is the most unmistakable, the latter the less painful&#x2026;the knowledge gained from the study of true history is the best of all educations for practical life.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This captures the meaning of what Hart calls the &#x201C;two forms of practical experience&#x201D;:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x2026;there are two forms of practical experience&#x2014;direct and indirect&#x2014;and that, of the two,&#xA0;<strong>indirect practical experience may be the more valuable because infinitely wider.</strong>&#xA0;Even in the most active career, especially a soldier&#x2019;s career, the scope and possibilities of direct experience are extremely limited. &#x2026;&#xA0;<strong>Direct experience is inherently too limited to form an adequate foundation either for theory or for application.</strong>&#xA0;At the best it produces an atmosphere that is of value in drying and hardening the structure of thought. The greater value of indirect experience lies in its greater variety and extent.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In a single lifetime, we feel we experience so much.&#xA0;Yet, this experience is still limited by the span of a single life.</p>
<p>We are shaped powerfully and uncontrollably by our places of birth, our cultures, our upbringings and our professions. This provides perspective but also clouds our vision: we always see the world through colored glasses.</p>
<p>Hart argues that the study of history extends our &#x201C;life&#x201D; from dozens of years to the thousands:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;How often do people claim superior wisdom on the score of their age and experience. The Chinese especially regard age with veneration, and hold that a man of eighty years or more must be wiser than others. But eighty is nothing for a student of history. There is no excuse for anyone who is not illiterate if he is less than three thousand years old in mind.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, let&#x2019;s look at another benefit of indirect experience&#x2014;it lets us live more than once.</p>
<h2 id="babies-and-tattoos"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#babies-and-tattoos" name="user-content-babies-and-tattoos" aria-hidden="true"></a>Nine Lives</h2>
<p>I admit it. Both babies and tattoos terrify me.</p>
<p>Many of the small decisions in life&#x2014;what breakfast cereal you eat, what socks you wear in the morning, etc.&#x2014;are reversible and low impact. But some decisions (babies more than tattoos, I guess) are irreversible. Those years we spend at a job we hate or with a spouse that torments us will never come back.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, to make the best decision&#xA0;<em>in advance</em>.</p>
<p>This is the benefit of indirect experience. Hart understood that a soldier&#x2019;s time on the battlefield is limited. In a situation where any decision could mean life or death, the majority of learning must happen indirectly.</p>
<p>Likewise, I may not be able to test drive a baby or a spouse, but I can look at history and see what choices others have made, using their successes and failures to help guide my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-pass-go"><a class="headeranchor-link" href="#do-not-pass-go" name="user-content-do-not-pass-go" aria-hidden="true"></a>Do vs. Do Not</h2>
<p>We can&#x2019;t predict the future.</p>
<p>Though many people in the past thought they could use history to divine the future (and people today&#x2014;in finance, for example&#x2014;continue to do so), history can never show us what will happen in ten, a hundred or a thousand years.</p>
<p>What history does do, says Hart, is show us patterns:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;History has limitations as guiding signpost, however, for although it can show us the right direction, it does not give detailed information about the road conditions. But its negative value as a warning sign is more definite.&#xA0;<strong>History can show us what to avoid, even if it does not teach us what to do&#x2014;by showing the most common mistakes that mankind is apt to make and to repeat.</strong>&#x201C;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Hart&#x2019;s advice to use history to learn what&#xA0;<em>not</em>&#xA0;to do reminds me of a essay from the great French writer Michel de Montaigne.</p>
<p>In&#xA0;<em>Of the art of discussion</em>&#xA0;(found in his&#xA0;<em><a href="http://amzn.to/2DWidHr">Essays</a></em>) he tells us he learns better from&#xA0;<em>non-examples</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;There may be some people of my temperament, I who learn better by contrast than by example, and by flight than by pursuit. It was the sort of teaching that Cato the Elder had in view when he said that the wise have more to learn from the fools than the fools from the wise; and also that ancient lyre player who &#x2026; was accustomed to force his pupils to go hear a bad musician who lived across the way, where they might learn to hate his discords and false measures.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If we are interested in living well, we may profit more from studying those, alive or dead, who have&#xA0;<em>failed</em>&#xA0;instead of those who have succeeded.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;What stings, touches and arouses us better than what pleases. &#x2026; Being little taught by good examples, I make use of the bad ones, whose lessons are common. I have tried to make myself as agreeable as I saw others unpleasant, as firm as I saw others lax, as mild as I saw others violent.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>
