					<p>It&#x2019;s my second time in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and I&#x2019;ve decided I&#x2019;m coming back every year.</p>
<p>The city is a bootstrapper&#x2019;s paradise. If you&#x2019;ve got an idea but no money and no network, I can&#x2019;t think of a better place to get started. A lot of the wild success this blog has seen in the last two months (over 3000 subscribers!) has been fueled by the Chiang Mai environment.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons why Chiang Mai is so good for bootstrapping:</p>
<ul>
<li>First world quality of life at third world prices (for $800 a month, I get what would cost $4000+ at home)</li>
<li>Fast, quality internet</li>
<li>Cheap automation of everyday tasks (laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc.)</li>
<li>A large community of creatives and freelancers (it&#x2019;s the #1 hub in Asia)</li>
<li>Real espresso (not that brown water we drink in America)</li>
</ul>
<p>By outsourcing the non-essentials, I&#x2019;ve set up my life here so that I only need to freelance for 4 hours a week to cover expenses.</p>
<p>The rest of my time goes towards crazy experiments, many of which I share in my newsletter, <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/theopencircle">The Open Circle</a>.&#xA0;Or, when I&#x2019;m feeling lazy, I can take a week off without worry over paying bills.</p>
<p>Some stuff I&#x2019;ve outsourced for next to no cost in Chiang Mai:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Many apartments in Chiang Mai come with cleaning 4 times a month.</li>
<li><strong>Cooking</strong>: The city has cheap cuisine from every country imaginable. Most meals are in the $1-5 range. I cook 95% of my meals when I&#x2019;m in say, Tokyo, but never in Chiang Mai.</li>
<li><strong>Laundry</strong>: Drop off our clothes and have them washed, dried, pressed and folded within 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Photography</strong>: Get professional shots for your business at 25% of prices back home.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: First world medical treatment at a fraction of the cost (and time)! This includes blood work, dental treatment, surgery and even the cosmetic stuff (if that&#x2019;s your thing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Set up these systems and free the time to focus on what matters: growing your business (or your projects).</p>
<h2>A Sample Monthly Budget For Chiang Mai, Thailand</h2>
<p>The most frugal of people can live on ~$500-600. I find my personal sweet spot is around $800, but some people (especially if you enjoy night life) might spend quite a bit more.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what an actual a month of expenses looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Housing: $200</strong> for a studio apartment with a/c, cleaning and utilities included (and the best coffee shop in town built into it)</li>
<li><strong>Phone: $12</strong> for 3GB of 4G data plus a phone number (I don&#x2019;t use this: I just keep my Google Fi plan because I want my US number)</li>
<li><strong>Food: $300</strong> to eat out well for 3-5 meals a day (I eat a lot)</li>
<li><strong>Coffee: $90</strong> for 2 cups a day of excellent, barista-made coffee. (Most) coffee shops come with fast wifi so you can just grab your coffee and get to work.</li>
<li><strong>Gym Membership: $30</strong> for an excellent gym with free weights, bars, treadmills (ugh), gymnastic rings, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Transportation: &lt;$50</strong> (I mostly walk and take taxis, but you can rent a motorbike for $60)</li>
<li><strong>Visa: $60-$100</strong> (There are 3 main options here: visa on arrival, tourist visa or education visa.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total cost: about $750</strong></p>
<p>To give you an idea of what prices are like, here are some other amenities you might consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full body massage (2 hours): $15</li>
<li><a href="http://www.punspace.com/">Coworking space</a>: $99 a month</li>
<li>BBQ buffets: $5-10</li>
<li>A 3-day outdoor <a href="http://www.thailandclimbing.com/courses/3-day-climbing-foundations/">rock climbing course</a>: $110</li>
<li>Cooking classes: $20</li>
</ul>
<p>There really isn&#x2019;t anything I&#x2019;ve seriously wanted for here. If anything, I start missing some of the nice things when I&#x2019;m not here.</p>
<p>Interested in getting started? I&#x2019;ve also included a list of the resources to help you get step up in Chiang Mai.</p>
<h2>Chiang Mai Entrepreneur Resource List</h2>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>Don&#x2019;t book housing on the internet&#x2014;most good places aren&#x2019;t listed. And AirBnB is overpriced.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what to do instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book a hotel for 1-2 weeks (you can find good ones for under $15 a night). Use <a href="http://tripadvisor.com">TripAdvisor</a>&#xA0;to find hotels.</li>
<li>Get a feel for the major areas in Chiang Mai (the Old City, Nimman, etc.). <a href="https://www.google.co.th/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtweva8KzQAhUMP48KHYceAGwQFggbMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikitravel.org%2Fen%2FChiang_Mai&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHjEq5bcBs-Fi_SdW0Yiy-PtDdTQ&amp;sig2=sPoJSZ-wWOnmxbzOWDBF2g">Wikitravel</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> are a good reference.</li>
<li>Select the areas most suited for your goals. (This will most likely be the trendy, upscale Nimman area&#x2014;most of the entrepreneurs and expats stay here.)</li>
<li>Spend a day shortlisting apartments in those areas</li>
<li>Make the booking.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#x2019;re bootstrapping with a whole team, you might want to consider renting an entire house. You can get one that fits 4 people a little bit outside of the city for $300 a month.</p>
<h3>Work Spaces / Coworking</h3>
<p>There are coffee shops equipped with wifi every few feet in Chiang Mai, so you&#x2019;ll never have to worry about finding a place to work.</p>
<p>If you want a more focused, work-specific environment, here are a few candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://punspace.com">Punspace</a>. The premier coworking space in Chiang Mai, with two locations. Lots of people working on interesting projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/manaspacechiangmai/">MANA</a>. A small coworking space run by a couple. If you prefer a quieter environment, you might like this one.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.openchiangmai.com/camp-creative-and-meeting-place-maya/">Camp.</a> Giant library cafe open 24 hours. It&#x2019;s popular both with entrepreneurs and the local students.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Communities / Networking</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, there are three expat communities in Chiang Mai. There are the hippy types, the retired-for-life types and the &#x201C;digital nomad&#x201D; entrepreneur types.</p>
<p>Here are two strategies for meeting the third group:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go to coworking spaces.</strong> The environment in these places, especially Punspace, is quite open to chatter. Many of them will also hold weekly events where you can meet people.</li>
<li><strong>Be active in Facebook communities.</strong> If you search for &#x201C;Chiang Mai X&#x201D; and replace X with your profession of interest (entrepreneurs, writers, photographers, foodies) you can find a large population of like-minded people to start collaborating with.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Things (Flights, Visas, etc.)</h3>
<p>I&#x2019;ll spare you the details about flights, visa arrangements and whatnot. A lot of that is available with a quick google search, and it&#x2019;s not rocket science. Everybody in Chiang Mai has worked out how to deal with it (some of them for <em>decades</em>). It&#x2019;s confusing at first, but it just becomes part of the life.</p>
<h3>A Word on Mental Limiters</h3>
<p>I was chatting with my friend Rob (who writes for MakeUseOf) about why the atmosphere in Chiang Mai is so ideal. It&#x2019;s a combination of two factors, I think: (1) the environment and (2) the type of people the environment attracts.</p>
<p>The people looking for nightlife, good food and general pleasure-seeking can get it elsewhere in Thailand (Bangkok, Phuket). Only those looking to do great work come to Chiang Mai.</p>
<p>Chiang Mai naturally &#x2018;selects&#x2019; for people who have that entrepreneurial streak. People who buy that first plane ticket to come here have removed their &#x2018;mental limiters&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s not money that stops people; it&#x2019;s fear.</p>
