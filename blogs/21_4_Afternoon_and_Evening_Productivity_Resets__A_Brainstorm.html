					<p><em>A reddit post I wrote hit the top of /r/productivity. In it, I mentioned I had some stuff cooking for combating evening productivity fallout, so here it is.</em><br><em><br></em>Even while traveling to 9+ countries, my morning routine has been pretty stable: meditate, water, movement, coffee. I&#x2019;ve purposely chosen things that are available anywhere in the world to minimize derailing. </p>
<p>As a result, <strong>75% of my daily productive work comes in the first 6-8 hours of my day.</strong> The other 8-10 hours, however, have been a sticking point.</p>
<p>I suspect several culprits:</p>
<p><strong>Willpower Decline.</strong>  <br>Our willpower level (a.k.a HP bar) declines throughout the day. Cognitive fatigue kicks in during the later hours, making it harder to take focused action.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Habit Chaining.</strong>  <br>My morning habit works because it always starts the same way: waking up. Each habit is followed automatically by the next and naturally flows into focused work. In the afternoon, I don&#x2019;t have the privilege of waking up.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Sugar Control.</strong>  <br>Fat adapted individuals don&#x2019;t get the mid-afternoon tiredness that high-carb eaters do. It seems worth testing a lower-carb, higher-fat approach. (I&#x2019;m actually already doing this with MCTs in the form of coconut oil in the AM).</p>
<p><strong>Old Habits.</strong>  <br>Old, ingrained habits naturally make me want to &#x201C;relax&#x201D; or &#x201C;eat something sweet&#x201D; in the late afternoon and evening. These have been reinforced through years and years of Pavlovian conditioning&#x2014;not easy to reverse.</p>

<h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
<div></div>
<p>Now that we&#x2019;ve identified some potential causes, we can test and retest with some possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Afternoon naps.</strong> Heavily researched and recommended. This is a double-hitter for me because (a) it gives a platform for starting an afternoon habit chain and (b) it might replenish willpower stores.</li>
<li><strong>Carb cycling.</strong> I&#x2019;ve played around with this in the past, with good results. Idea is to eat much lower carb, replenishing your energy stores 1-2 times a week. Your body adapts to run much more on fat and has fewer energy swings throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>Habit Firewalling / Overriding</strong> In college, I froze my credit card in an ice block to keep myself from using it. I want to take a similar approach with &#x201C;no screens&#x201D; in the evening by &#x201C;firewalling&#x201D; the temptation and then &#x201C;overriding&#x201D; it with a better habit. 
<ul>
<li>Firewall can be done by shutting off smartphone and computer and storing it in a difficult to access place. If you live with a friend, you can ask them to safeguard your stuff in the evening. Maybe make a wager with a friend and pay them $10 if you can&#x2019;t control yourself.</li>
<li>Overriding tries to replace a negative &#x201C;trigger&#x201D; with a positive one. Instead of mindless internet browsing, when the desire to &#x201C;Netflix and chill&#x201D; comes, I&#x2019;m going to (a) brew some tea and read a book or (b) go out for a walk. Not sure how well this will work as my willpower stores run low in the evening&#x2014;just a tentative solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x2013;<br>Going to be playing with these over the next few weeks in Tokyo. Then flying off to China! Don&#x2019;t forget to subscribe if you like what you&#x2019;re reading.</p>
