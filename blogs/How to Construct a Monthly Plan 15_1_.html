					<p>Some of you have asked how I tackle goal-setting.</p>
<p>Today also happens to be the first of the month&#x2014;the day that I do my monthly plan.</p>
<p>So here&#x2019;s a look at the process.</p>
<h1>Why make a monthly plan?</h1>
<p>There are two key benefits to a monthly plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>It forces you to think carefully about what you want to do that month (and, consequently, what you want from the next quarter, the next year and the decade).</li>
<li>It&#x2019;s a black and white indicator of performance&#x2014;either you achieve your goal or you don&#x2019;t.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are general steps to take when making a plan.</p>
<h1>1. Review and Reflect</h1>
<p>Before I draft my plan, I do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take another look at quarterly and yearly goals</li>
<li>Review the last month</li>
</ul>
<p>This review helps you (a) keep future goals in mind when designing your monthly goal and (b) avoid mistakes made during your last month.</p>
<p>My goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yearly Goal (Ends September 2017):</strong> Publish a book and sell 5000 copies in the first week.</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly Goal (Ends this month):</strong> Grow email following to 10,000 readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not obvious, my quarterly goal is intimately tied to my yearly goal&#x2014;I did a quick feasibility analysis, and I want to have an email list of 100k+ when my book comes out.</p>
<p>Then a review of last month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What went well?</strong> The blog got traction much faster than I was expecting, with excellent performances on Medium and popular publications like the Observer.</li>
<li><strong>What went poorly?</strong> I am increasingly distracted by emails, interview offers, pitches, etc. This is taking away from writing time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, with the above in mind, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a monthly goal that is in line with our quarterly goal.</li>
<li>Draft a plan to avoid major pitfalls from last month.</li>
</ul>
<h1>2. Set the Monthly Objective</h1>
<p>Because this is the last month of this quarter (Q4), the objective is very simple: <strong>reach 10k email subscribers.</strong></p>
<p>The harder part is taking the objective and converting it into &#x201C;high-probability&#x201D; actions&#x2026;</p>
<h1>3. Do the Deep Thinking (And Select Core Actions)</h1>
<p>This is the deep thinking part of the plan. Here, we take our overarching goal (10k subscribers) and convert it into an action plan for the month.</p>
<p><a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/theopencircle">The Open Circle</a> currently has about 6000 readers, so we need to bring 4000 new people onboard to reach our goal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&#x2019;t wake up in the morning, brush my teeth and then sit down to &#x201C;get email subscribers&#x201D;.</p>
<p>What drives email signups?</p>
<p>There are two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get blog traffic</li>
<li>Increase the conversion rate of our website</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#x2019;s convert these into actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make good content and share it (therefore growing traffic to the site)</li>
<li>Give people a good reason to join and make it easily visible (making it more likely for people to sign up)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, some final thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>To reach my goal of 10k subscribers, I need 4000 people to signup for the month</li>
<li>At a signup rate of 10%, that means I need to have 40,000 new visitors to the site this month</li>
<li>A single &#x201C;home run&#x201D; blog post can bring 30k-50k people to the site</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <strong>I only need a single home run this month to reach my goal.</strong></p>
<p>This then converts to the following immediate actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made modifications that bring conversions up to 10% ASAP</li>
<li>Publish two posts a week on the quality of your other home run posts (the past ones also took 2-3 days to write)
<ul>
<li>This gives me ~8 chances to get a single home run this month</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>4. Make it Memorable</h1>
<p>Okay, that was a lot of thinking.</p>
<p>Now, let&#x2019;s convert that into something short and memorable we can use each morning to prime our thinking.</p>
<p>Sebastian Marshall recommends the use of a &#x201C;mantra&#x201D;&#x2014;a short, memorable phrase that embodies your monthly objective.</p>
<p>My mantra for last month was &#x201C;GO PRO&#x201D;. The point was to phase freelancing out of my life so that I could spend more time on the blog.</p>
<p>For this month, the most significant to me is <em>proving to myself that I can constantly generate good content</em>.</p>
<p>The mantra for this month: <strong>BECOME PROOF</strong></p>
<p>##</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s all for the monthly review.</p>
<p>The key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the objective measurable (there&#x2019;s no &#x201C;half pregnant&#x201D;)</li>
<li>Take core KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and make those measurable as well (traffic, conversions, etc.)</li>
<li>Convert objective to immediate actions that can be taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, the few hours it takes to do this kind of planning each month can save days worth of missteps down the line.</p>
