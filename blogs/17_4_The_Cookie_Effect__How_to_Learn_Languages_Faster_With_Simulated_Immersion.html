					<p>I&#x2019;ve received a lot of emails asking how I learned Japanese in 18 months.</p>
<p>Successful language learners agree that languages are best learned best with live immersion&#x2014;I do this whenever I can.&#xA0;But dropping everything and blowing $2000 on a flight to Tokyo&#x2026;not everybody can do that.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s an answer: <strong>simulated immersion</strong>. With it, you&#xA0;can get 80% or more of the effects of live immersion without ever leaving home.</p>
<p>This is what I did for my first year of Japanese study. My university was in a small rural town in Florida. There were hardly a dozen Japanese speakers in the whole county!</p>
<p>All successful language learners I know use this method in one form or another.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s take a look</p>
<h2>Why Immersion?</h2>
<p>Several reasons why immersion is so powerful:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maximal Exposure</strong> &#x2013; you are exposed to the language from dawn to dusk. When I was learning Japanese, I would get 14+ hours of language exposure on some days. University languages classes rarely go above even 5 hours a week.<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Additive</strong> &#x2013; Adding too much to a busy schedule is a recipe for failure. Simulated immersion just switches daily life activities with identical ones in a different language &#x2013; your L2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Need-based Information</strong> &#x2013; Many classroom words and structures are never used in day to day conversation. Exposure to organic language (people talking) lets your brain focus on the most frequent words. These frequent words are also the words that give the most incremental improvement. Learning on a need-to-know basis instead of a just-in-case basis means fewer words forgotten and less wasted time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Built-in Feedback Loops</strong> &#x2013; feedback loops are crucial for development in any skill. In immersion, we have an efficient enjoyment-based feedback system in &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201D; and &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not fun.&#x201D; If we don&#x2019;t understand, we just find subject material that&#x2019;s easy enough to be enjoyable (but not boring).<br>
How do we simulate this immersive environment?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I like to use something called the <em>cookie effect</em>.</p>
<h2>The Cookie Effect</h2>
<p>We all know that the best way to avoid eating cookies is to not keep any cookies in the house. It&#x2019;s just too easy to cave in and take a bite during a moment of weakness.</p>
<p>What if we lived in an alternate universe where cookies give you six pack abs? A smart person would take the reverse approach &#x2013; put cookies in as many locations as possible for maximal cookie-crunching goodness. (You can get really strong by putting pullup bars all over the house.)</p>
<p>Simulated immersion is like reverse cookies &#x2013; we want to make our new language, our L2, as accessible as possible. How? <strong>Switch out your ordinary daily activities with similar activities in your L2.</strong> This is surprisingly easily. You&#x2019;re using already ingrained habits so there&#x2019;s low switching cost and no loading phase.</p>
<h3>Make the Switch</h3>
<p>The best things to switch are <strong>things you have to do</strong> and <strong>things you enjoy</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re learning Cantonese and love Bruce Lee, surround yourself with Bruce Lee movies. What the hell, buy some nunchucks and a yellow jumpsuit too. If you love bikini models from from Brazil, bookmark a bunch of Brazilian bikini-model blogs and browse them in your spare time. If it feels like work you&#x2019;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Some simple switches I used to learn Japanese:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS and browser language settings.</strong> I did this one early on. Chances are you use your computer everyday. It&#x2019;s a simple switch that will accustom you to seeing your L2. Everything will feel funny when you first switch, but I promise you won&#x2019;t die and you&#x2019;ll adapt quickly.<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TV, movies, and video.</strong> I don&#x2019;t watch movies or TV in English anymore. Video is one of the greatest mediums ever invented for language learning. You pick up a lot of the subtle cues that you&#x2019;ll never get in the classroom. It&#x2019;s second only to going out there and talking to real people. If you&#x2019;re a beginner, start out with subtitles and ween yourself off ASAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Music and podcasts.</strong> Transitionary time is a great way to add immersion without disturbing your day. Whenever I was walking anywhere or at the gym I would listen to Japanese music and podcasts. Just put your L2 audio in your smartphone and carry it everywhere with you. At one point I ripped the audio files from a 120+ episode TV show and listened to them over and over (nerd!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Friends.</strong> You spend time with friends away. Take some of your social time and spend it with L2 friends or conversation partners. If your local University or area doesn&#x2019;t have many speakers of your L2, resources like <a href="http://italki.com">italki</a> can be great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes.</strong> I&#x2019;m an obsessive note taker and always carry a notebook with me. When I was learning Japanese, I used Kanji characters to supplement my notes. They make for great shorthand! Don&#x2019;t try to do everything in L2, just write the words that you can remember and do the rest in English.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#x2019;t use willpower to drive your learning. Use the cookie effect. Try this, and I bet you&#x2019;ll see some outstanding improvements. With that said, this is a small piece of a complicated puzzle. More on this in the future.</p>
