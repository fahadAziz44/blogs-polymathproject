					<p>I&#x2019;m tired of the dream.</p>
<p>You hear it all over. Quit your job. Find your passion. Travel your world. Start a business. Make a million dollars. Oh, and do it all overnight.</p>
<p>Pffft, if only it were that easy.</p>
<p>In a way, I&#x2019;m guilty of feeding the dream. I quit my job a few years ago. I&#x2019;ve been to half a dozen countries this year. I started a small business.</p>
<p>But it didn&#x2019;t happen overnight. And it certainly didn&#x2019;t happen the way people think it did.</p>
<p>Think twice before you quit.</p>
<h1>The coconut fantasy</h1>
<p>People see the fantasy&#x2014;coconuts on beaches, multi-millionaire startup founders, the freedom of self-ownership&#x2014;and they get HUNGRY.</p>
<p>They think, &#x201C;Well, THEY did it. Why can&#x2019;t I? I&#x2019;ve got balls just as big!&#x201D; (You too, ladies.) So they quit their jobs. They buy a ticket to Thailand or Vietnam or some other &#x201C;paradise&#x201D;. There&#x2019;s fire in their eyes. They&#x2019;re gonna make the next great widget and it&#x2019;s gonna rocket them to fame.</p>
<p>Somehow, they&#x2019;ve almost completely missed all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&#x2019;t know if their business idea works or not</li>
<li>They don&#x2019;t even have an idea in the first place</li>
<li>They don&#x2019;t have any funding</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess what happens?</p>
<p>In less than 6 months, these same &#x201C;ballsy&#x201D; wantrepreneurs run home, tails hung in defeat. All they&#x2019;ve got to show is a load of credit card debt and a farmer&#x2019;s tan.</p>
<p>They go back to the same jobs. Or, even worse, their jobs aren&#x2019;t waiting for them anymore.</p>
<h1>Don&#x2019;t quit your job&#x2026;yet.</h1>
<p>I get it. You don&#x2019;t like your job. It&#x2019;s not fulfilling. You want to do something valuable. You want to be in charge.</p>
<p>I that&#x2019;s great. But, it&#x2019;s important <em>to be realistic</em>.</p>
<p>We glorify the &#x201C;make it or die trying&#x201D; mentality. But it&#x2019;s all a Hollywood wet dream. Real results don&#x2019;t happen that way. Real results are boring.</p>
<p>If you study the successes, you&#x2019;ll notice something interesting: everything is calculated&#x2014;no failure is ever no large that we can&#x2019;t get up tomorrow and try again.</p>
<h1>The Barbell Approach (What to do instead)</h1>
<p>Before you quit your job or dump everything to try something crazy, know this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#x2019;s no proof your business will work</li>
<li>There&#x2019;s no guarantee you&#x2019;ll &#x201C;find your passion&#x201D; anytime soon</li>
</ul>
<p>So should you give up?</p>
<p>Not quite. If you want it, go for it, I say. But they don&#x2019;t come easily, and they certainly won&#x2019;t come on the first try.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s going to take a lot of experiments, failed ventures and dead ends. There are no shortcuts.</p>
<p>Failures cost money.</p>
<p>Before you quit your job, start a business, or invest large amounts of capital into anything, you need to <strong>prove to yourself that it works.</strong></p>
<p>How to do this:</p>
<p><strong>1. Keep your current job.</strong> This is your cash cow. It&#x2019;s going to fund everything else that you do. Spend as little mental energy as possible while at work. You&#x2019;ll need it for later.</p>
<p><strong>2. Develop a breadwinner skill.</strong> You can&#x2019;t live off savings forever. You need a way to earn money first. Use your off-work hours (or on-work, if you&#x2019;re sneaky) to train yourself. If you don&#x2019;t have any hard skills (like programming), get some. If you do, learn the soft skills necessary to go independent (marketing, basic social skills, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>3. Barbell your experiments.</strong> This concept comes from Nassim Taleb&#x2019;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2hnglQE">Antifragile</a>, my favorite book of all time. Spend 80% of your time on &#x2018;safe things&#x2019; (your breadwinner skill) and invest the other 20% in &#x2018;risky&#x2019; experiments (new business ideas, etc.). This gives you a stable base to fall back on, which is what you really need to do the tinkering.</p>
<p>Keep using your &#x201C;20% time&#x201D; to do experiments. If you&#x2019;re failing a lot, figure out why. Learn from it. Keep refining the process.</p>
<p>Eventually, something will take off. Don&#x2019;t run with it yet. Keep testing assumptions for a few months. Make sure you&#x2019;re right.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s when you quit. When you <em>know</em> it works. Now you&#x2019;ve got a baby to grow. Maybe you&#x2019;ll even a travel a bit.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll see you on the other side.</p>
