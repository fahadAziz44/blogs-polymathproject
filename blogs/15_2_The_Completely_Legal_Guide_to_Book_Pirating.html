					<p>Last year, I read over 150 books.</p>
<p>At retail prices, that many books would have easily cost me over 1000 dollars.</p>
<p>Books are knowledge and knowledge is pricess&#x2014;or so they say. But what if you don&#x2019;t have the funds?</p>
<p>Is pirating the only choice?</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#x2019;ve come up with quite a few tricks for getting cheap books while staying on the right side of the law.</p>
<p>Let me share my favorite ones.</p>
<h1><a href="http://amzn.to/2gK4tHv">Kindle Unlimited</a></h1>
<p>Amazon&#x2019;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2gK4tHv">Kindle Unlimited program</a> offers unlimited free books a month for a small fee.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite books are on KU, but there are two downsides to the program: (1) the number of high quality books is limited and (2) there is a lot of noise in the form of self-published garbage.</p>
<p>What I recommend you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for a <a href="http://amzn.to/2gK4tHv">Kindle Unlimited</a> free trial</li>
<li>Read the best books that interest you (and take notes)</li>
<li>Cancel your membership</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some of my favorites on Kindle Unlimited:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2gpzHTI">Superhuman by Habit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2gpHOjo">Gateless</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2gKaW5c">Choose Yourself</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><a href="http://overdrive.com">Overdrive</a></h1>
<p>This tool is a lifesaver.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&#x2019;t know this, but most public libraries have large digital book collections.</p>
<p>Overdrive lets you check out ebooks and audiobooks for free using your local library card. The books disappear after the loan expires&#x2026;but you get to keep all your notes!</p>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t have a local card, there are <a href="http://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2011/09/22/library-ebooks-for-non-residents-where-to-get-ebooks-if-your-library-is-lacking/">some libraries</a> where you can pay a small yearly fee (&lt;$50) to access their collections.</p>
<h1><a href="http://audible.com">Audible</a></h1>
<p>The king of audiobook platforms. For $15 a month, you get 1 credit that you can trade for any audiobook.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a decent deal, but pricey if you are on the budget.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s some stuff I&#x2019;ve done to save money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for a <a href="http://amzn.to/2gM9Qnl">free trial</a> to get 2 free audiobooks.</li>
<li>Cancel your membership and select &#x201C;too expensive&#x201D; for the reason&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll get an offer for 50% off 3 months of membership.</li>
<li>&#x201C;Freeze&#x201D; your account and wait for special Audible sales, where bestsellers can go for heavy discounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I listen to a <em>lot</em> of audio, and I&#x2019;d be lost without Audible. This is one of the tools where it&#x2019;s worth it to go ahead and pay the subscription. There are quite a few resources that aren&#x2019;t available in any other format. For a real treat, check out <a href="http://amzn.to/2gKeiW5">Famous Greeks</a>&#x2014;the whole 12 hours are a clinic in masterful storytelling.</p>
<h1><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a></h1>
<p>The majority of books &#x201C;worth re-reading&#x201D; are old books. They&#x2019;ve survived for a reason, after all.</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg offers these old, copyright free books for free download. The books come in all the popular formats (mobi, epub, pdf, txt, etc.).</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s a link to the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top">top 100 most downloaded books</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re lazy like me, you can download direct from Amazon by doing a search for Kindle classics that are priced at $0.00.</p>
<h1><a href="http://bookfinder.com">Bookfinder</a></h1>
<p>Bookfinder is the best tool out there for finding used copies of physical books.</p>
<p>It does a blanket search of all the used book distributors out there (Amazon, Abebooks, etc.) and sorts them by lowest price.</p>
<p>Many good books can be found at the $3-$5 price range, with shipping included!</p>
<p>&#x2014;</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s it&#x2014;the 5 tools I&#x2019;ve used to get free or massively discounted books.</p>
<p>One caveat: If you can at all afford it, I suggest allocating $50-$100 a month to a &#x201C;self-education&#x201D; budget. By forcing yourself to spend money, you&#x2019;ll reinforce the importance of learning in your mind (severely undervalued).</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
