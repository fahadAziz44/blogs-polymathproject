					<p>I&#x2019;ve been writing for 2 years now.</p>
<p>Every day, no matter where I am, I wake up and write.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#x2019;ve learned along the way.</p>
<h3>If you aren&#x2019;t writing every day, you&#x2019;re lying to yourself</h3>
<p>A lot of my friends say they want to be writers. But when I ask about it, all I get are excuses.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ve been meaning too, but I&#x2019;m too busy with [useless activity X]&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bullshit. Talk is cheap.</p>
<p>If you want to be a writer, <em>you have to write.</em> Tired? Write. Hungover? Write. Out with friends? Run into the bathroom and <em>write</em>.</p>
<p>Wake up, drink a glass of water and get at it. Smart small. Don&#x2019;t start with 4 hours. Or even 1 hour. Start with one sentence.</p>
<p>If you can&#x2019;t write a sentence every day, you don&#x2019;t want to be writer.</p>
<h3>It&#x2019;ll always be scary</h3>
<p>Not writing is safe.</p>
<p>Not writing means no judgment. No criticism. No laughter.</p>
<p>But not writing means&#x2026;no writing.</p>
<p>And that&#x2019;s much worse.</p>
<p>Every time I look at the publish button, I start to think: <em>What if it sucks?</em> <em>What if nobody reads it?</em> The voices are quieter now. But they never go away.</p>
<h3>Nobody has to see your shit</h3>
<p>The real reason we get writer&#x2019;s block: we&#x2019;re scared.</p>
<p>You don&#x2019;t have to publish from day 1. Or day 100. It took me two years to publish anything. And that&#x2019;s just on the internet.</p>
<p>I get it. Writing is hard. But remember: nobody has to see your writing but you.</p>
<p>Start small. Keep a journal. Put words in it. Don&#x2019;t even re-read. After a while, the fear lessens. Then you can take another step. Maybe do some editing. One more step. Maybe show some friends. Then another step&#x2026;</p>
<p>You&#x2019;ll get there.</p>
<h3>What are you sacrificing?</h3>
<p>We can have anything we want. But not everything. Somebody famous said that. I forgot who.</p>
<p>What will you sacrifice for the privilege to write?</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t drink. I live frugally. I&#x2019;m alone most mornings. Most afternoons too. I say no to parties. I don&#x2019;t make a lot of money.</p>
<p>And I&#x2019;d do it all gain.</p>
<h3>Writing is unlearning</h3>
<p>School makes for bad writers.</p>
<p>In school, we learn to use facts, not feelings. We learn to chase metrics, not moments. We learn to tell and not to show.</p>
<p>All in the name of &#x2018;education&#x2019;.</p>
<p>And now, as writers, we have to unlearn it all.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m still no good . But I&#x2019;m unlearning every day.</p>
<h3>&#x2018;Just write more&#x2019; is NOT good advice</h3>
<p>Writers suck at giving writing advice. It&#x2019;s a universal truth.</p>
<p><strong>Common advice #1: &#x201C;just write more.&#x201D;</strong> Bullllshittt. One of my favorite bloggers, <a href="http://tynan.com">Tynan</a>, has been writing for 7 years. Five books later, his writing still sucks. Love you, Tynan.</p>
<p>Just writing isn&#x2019;t enough. There has to be process. Failure. Feedback. Chunking. &#x201C;Natural&#x201D; writers do this instinctively and then pass on bad advice.</p>
<p><strong>Common advice #2: &#x201C;just read more.&#x201D;</strong> Okay. Yes, reading makes you better. But there&#x2019;s two kinds of reading: active reading and passive reading. In one case, you&#x2019;re just inhaling words. In the other, you&#x2019;re participating. You&#x2019;re asking questions like: &#x201C;What is the structure?&#x201D;, &#x201C;Why did the author do this?&#x201D;, &#x201C;What would I do in his or her place?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Both of these are &#x201C;reading&#x201D;. But the outcomes are entirely different.</p>
<p>Learn a bit about learning&#x2014;it goes a long way.</p>
<h3>A lot of writing happens away from the page</h3>
<p>There was an interview with Seth Godin. The interviewer asked, &#x201C;How much time do you spend writing?&#x201D; His answer: &#x201C;Oh, you mean typing? Maybe 15 minutes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Writing isn&#x2019;t just what happens on screen. Or on paper.</p>
<p>A lot of it is in the head. My best &#x2018;writing&#x2019; happens during long walks. Most days I spend several hours walking. That&#x2019;s when the ideas come.</p>
<p>When I something pops into mind, I talk to myself. If you can&#x2019;t express it out loud, you probably can&#x2019;t write it. If I can&#x2019;t voice it, I&#x2019;ll try to figure out why. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, then I&#x2019;ll file it away for another day.</p>
<p>Clear writing is clear thinking.</p>
<h3>Follow the rules. Then break the rules.</h3>
<p>Rules exist for one reason: to protect idiots from themselves.</p>
<p>And when we start out, we&#x2019;re all idiots. So follow the rules. Read Strunk&#x2019;s book. Edit religiously. Ask teachers for feedback. Take classes.</p>
<p>Learn to be normal. Learn to be average.</p>
<p>Then start breaking the rules.</p>
