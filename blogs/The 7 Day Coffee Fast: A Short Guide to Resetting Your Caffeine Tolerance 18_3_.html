					<p>At 4 cups a day, something had to change.</p>
<p>I was inhaling idiotic amounts of the brown liquid of the gods&#x2014;known to us mortals as <em>le coffee.</em></p>
<p>It was deep frying my adrenals. And my wallet.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s when I found <a href="http://arvindn.livejournal.com/57651.html" rel="nofollow">the calculus of caffeine consumption</a>&#x2014;a short piece on optimal caffeine use by Princeton CS professor Arvind Narayanan.</p>
<p>The basics:</p>
<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0">
<li><strong>Caffeine gives you focus</strong> by blocking adenosine (a sleep chemical).</li>
<li><strong>The change is temporary.</strong> Our body adapts by making <em>more</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Narayanan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the long term, consistent caffeine consumption is as good as non-consumption, because of (you guessed it) tolerance.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, should we just give up drinking coffee altogether?</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Welcome to the<strong>&#xA0;7 Day Coffee Fast.&#xA0;</strong>The technique is simple: <strong>spend one week a month with little or no caffeine consumption.</strong></p>
<p>Why a week? Narayanan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;With complete abstinence, it takes 5 days to reach adenosine normality; conservatively, and with imperfect abstinence, a week or 10 days may be required.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>A week lets you (and by you, I mean me) get away with drinking decaf.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>I kept all of my routines and habits the same.</li>
<li>I replaced regular coffee with decaf.</li>
</ol>
<p>Less change means more adherence.</p>
<p>This caffeine deload fits well into natural human work cycles.</p>
<p>Or, as Narayanan puts it in big English:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;For most people, work involves a natural cyclic pattern of crunches and lean periods, and moderated coffee consumption to reflect this pattern <strong>will let you enjoy its cognition-enhancing effects more-or-less permanently.</strong>&#x201C;</p></blockquote>
<p>You hear the man. It&#x2019;s a permanent solution to caffeine tolerance.</p>
<p>When you plan your next month, pick a down week and schedule a 7 day coffee fast. There&#x2019;ll be a temporary dip in output, but you&#x2019;ll see massive improvements in the long term.</p>
<p>Your work (and your adrenals) will thank you for it.</p>
