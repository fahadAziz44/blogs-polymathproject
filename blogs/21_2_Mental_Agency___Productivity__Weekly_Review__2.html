					<p><em>Since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/52chpr/i_spent_the_last_week_keeping_a_brutally_honest/">my first public weekly review</a> was such as hit on Reddit, I thought I&#x2019;d continue putting these up so that the readers can follow (and learn) from my progress.</em><br><em><span style="font-size: large;"><br></span></em><strong><span style="font-size: large;">So, how did I do this week?</span></strong></p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="315" src width="640"></a></div>
<p></p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>This week&#x2019;s average: 3.56. <br>Last week&#x2019;s average: 3.27.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a <em>slight</em> increase that totals to ~3.5 hours of extra focused work this week. But this was to be expected, as I made several changes that I expected would decrease effectiveness in the short term:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started reading, listening to podcasts, attending workshops, etc. that I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to track (and didn&#x2019;t). </li>
<li>I cut carbs this week to less than half the week prior (losing weight already)! Had the carb flu (lethargy, dry mouth, etc.) for a few days.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">What I&#x2019;m Changing This Week</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly divided, I see my time spent in three areas (a) high quality, creative time, (b) neutral and/or slightly positive time, and (c) garbage, wasteful time. 
<ul>
<li>Last week&#x2019;s spreadsheet only tracked creative time. This week, I&#x2019;d like to track the other times as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I want to see more clearly the interplay between physical training and creative work. This week I&#x2019;m going to track them separately.</li>
<li>My &#x201C;planned day&#x201D; and &#x201C;no screens&#x201D; checkboxes had essentially zero adherence. I blame this on a lack of rigid rules for entering the process of turning off the screens. This week I will set more rigid, un-fudgeable rules.</li>
<li>I tracked morale this week, but (a) it was quite subjective and (b) I wasn&#x2019;t sure what time of day to use as the metric.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Taking the above into consideration, here&#x2019;s what this week&#x2019;s spreadsheet looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="379" src width="640"></a></div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Moved morale to the top. Want to see how morale upon waking up affects the rest of my day. In the future I will be playing with ways to affect AM morale and keep it up throughout the day.</li>
<li>Added more specific rule for no screens (everything off by 8pm).</li>
<li>Added &#x201C;Garbage&#x201D;&#x2014;a slot for tracking wasted time (time that neither adds to present nor future satisfaction).</li>
<li>Split &#x201C;Training&#x201D; and &#x201C;Work&#x201D; into separate categories to better see how both fluctuate.</li>
<li>Added a &#x201C;First Carbs&#x201D; slot for seeing how first carb intake affects output and total carb consumption for the day.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Tangible Goals for the Week</span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-size: large;"><br></span></strong>Last week we averaged 2.25 hours of focused work and 1.3 hours of training a day. This week we are aiming for <strong>3.5 hours of focused work and 2 hours of training</strong>. That would put us at 5.5 hours per day, and add 14 hours of trackable &#x201C;doing&#x201D; for this week.</p>
<p>Review, make changes, test, repeat. That&#x2019;s how change happens.</p>
