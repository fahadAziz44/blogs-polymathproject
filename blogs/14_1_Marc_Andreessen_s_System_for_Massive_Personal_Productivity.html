					<p>If you&#x2019;re a tech person, you already know who Marc Andreessen is.</p>
<p>He co-founded Netscape. He&#x2019;s a serial entrepreneur. He runs a venture capital firm with $1.2 billion under management. He&#x2019;s also got his hands in Facebook, Ebay and dozens of other important things.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, his life can get a bit disorganized.</p>
<p>Recently, I stumbled onto <a href="http://pmarchive.com/">this archive</a> of Marc Andreessen&#x2019;s old blog. In it, he writes extensively about his personal productivity system.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a lazy person. I&#x2019;m always looking to get the maximum effect from minimal effort.</p>
<p>Why build a productivity system from ground up when Marc has done the heavy thinking already?</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s take a look and steal everything we can.</p>
<h2>1. Keep only three lists</h2>
<p>Here&#x2019;s how Marc manages his tasks.</p>
<p>He keeps only three lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Todo List &#x2014; Everything that has to be done&#x2014;commitments, tasks, obligations&#x2014;goest here. If you want, the list can be sorted into days, weeks, months, etc.</li>
<li>A &#x2018;Watch&#x2019; List &#x2014; Things that require external events go here. This can be a future reminder, a followup with someone else, a response to a reply, etc.</li>
<li>A Later List &#x2014; All the low intensity or low priority tasks so be done at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything that doesn&#x2019;t fit into these lists &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t exist&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Like myself, Marc finds Daven Allen&#x2019;s popular <a href="http://amzn.to/2gejnl1">Getting Things Done</a> system too bulky to deal with:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For me, an organization system that requires significant time to deal with in and of itself is not optimal. Much better, for me at least, is to focus on stripping away nonessentials and freeing up as much time as possible to deal with whatever is most important.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed. More complexity isn&#x2019;t the answer.</p>
<h2>2a Before bed, make a MIT notecard</h2>
<blockquote><p>
  I sit down at my desk before I go to sleep, pull up my Todo List (which I keep in Microsoft Word&#x2019;s outline mode, due to long habit), and pick out the 3 to 5 things I am going to get done tomorrow. I write those things on a fresh 3&#xD7;5 card, lay the card out with my card keys, and go to bed. Then, the next day, I try like hell to get just those things done. <strong>If I do, it was a successful day.</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here it is again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull up your Todo List</li>
<li>Choose 3 to 5 MITs (most important tasks) for tomorrow</li>
<li>Write those on a card</li>
<li>Go to sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice this is done <em>before</em> bed. There&#x2019;s a reason for this&#x2014;you want to get on tackling tacks as soon as you wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>Andreessen calls this one of the most successful techniques he has ever tried:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Once you get into the habit, you start to realize how many days you used to have when you wouldn&#x2019;t get 3 to 5 important/significant/meaningful things done during a day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#x2019;s not all there is to the card, though.</p>
<h2>2b Use the notecard as an &#x201C;Anti-Todo List&#x201D;</h2>
<p>The next day, Marc carries the notecard with him and uses the back to track wins.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you do anything that day, write it on the back of your MIT Card.</li>
<li>Review your Anti-Todo List at the end of the day. Celebrate your accomplishments.</li>
<li>Discard or document the card.<br>
Marc mentions the psychological lever behind this technique:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>
  Each time you do something, you get to write it down and you get that little rush of endorphins that the mouse gets every time he presses the button in his cage and gets a food pellet.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#x2019;s also something to be said for &#x201C;celebrating wins&#x201D;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#x2026;by writing down things on my Anti-Todo list as I accomplish them throughout the day makes me feel marvelously productive and efficient. Far more so than if I just did those things and didn&#x2019;t write them down.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>How to implement Marc&#x2019;s system</h2>
<p>The beauty of this system is its simplicity. At a base level, all you need is a notepad (for the 3 lists), a notecard and a pen.</p>
<p>Although I prefer analog, you can replicate this digitally like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a todo list manager like <a href="http://wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a> to manage your tasks</li>
<li>Keep the MIT Notecard and your Anti-Todo List in a smartphone app like <a href="http://google.com/keep">Google Keep</a>. Or, just use more lists in your todo list app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I&#x2019;m phasing out my smartphone. I went and picked up a stack of notecards today. Excited to try this.</p>
