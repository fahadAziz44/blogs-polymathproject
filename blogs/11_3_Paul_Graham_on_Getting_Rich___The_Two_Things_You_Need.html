					<p>There are many ways to get rich.</p>
<p>But, in my mind, there&#x2019;s only one <em>real</em> way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;Want to become a billionaire? Then help a billion people.&#x201D; -Peter Diamandis</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Graham knows all about getting rich this way. He did it in 1998, when his company, Viaweb, sold to Yahoo! for $49.6 million.</p>
<p>Now, he helps others do the same a Y Combinator, which helps &#x201C;incubate&#x201D; promising new startups. The combined value of YC companies is over $65 billion dollars.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="http://amzn.to/2p55HPx">Hackers &amp; Painters</a>, Paul Graham has a chapter titled &#x201C;How to Make Wealth&#x201D; that shares the principles behind getting rich.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s take a look.</p>
<h2>The Weight of the Average</h2>
<p>First, let me clarify something.</p>
<p>Money and wealth are not the same. Money&#x2014;be it pieces of paper or numbers on a screen&#x2014;is a <em>store</em> of value. Wealth, on the other hand, is value itself.</p>
<p>Businesses (non-corrupt ones, at least) aren&#x2019;t about making money:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage&#x2014;just a shorthand&#x2014;for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, there&#x2019;s a downside to working for a company. Whenever you&#x2019;re part of a bigger whole, you can become burdened with the &#x201C;weight of the average&#x201D;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;<strong>In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people&#x2019;s.</strong> &#x2026; if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>These days, people throw around the word &#x201C;equality.&#x201D; But let us not confuse equality of opportunity with equality of <em>outcome</em>.</p>
<p>Graham mentions how two programmers (getting the same salary) can be entirely different in effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;&#x2026;there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. <strong>A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).</strong>&#x201C;</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>This explains why it&#x2019;s hard to get rich in big, slow-moving companies:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;If you want to go faster, it&#x2019;s a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people&#x2019;s. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable&#x2014;and the rest of the group slows you down.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Two Conditions for Riches</h2>
<p>At a company, if your work helps a million people, you probably won&#x2019;t become a millionaire. That&#x2019;s because you aren&#x2019;t directly paid for wealth created.</p>
<p>So the first step to riches is to step away from this to a system where <em>you are directly rewarded for your contribution.</em></p>
<p>Paul Graham calls this quality <strong>measurement</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more.</p></blockquote>
<p>An example of this is software development. If I develop software on my own, selling it to 10,000 people instead of 100 people gives me 100 times the payoff. I get paid for doing more and reaching further.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a second piece to the puzzle, though. How are you going to help a million people in the first place?</p>
<p>People that do this, says Paul Graham, are in positions with <strong>leverage</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;&#x2026;you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone who gets rich <em>of their own efforts</em> has both of these qualities, says Graham:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;I think every one who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>But I&#x2019;m not big on &#x201C;riches for riches&#x201D; sake. I&#x2019;m more interested in the wealth side of things. I want to be rewarded for helping as many people as possible.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s so appealing about writing.</p>
<p>The way I have my writing income set up (via <a href="http://patreon.com/charleschu">Patreon</a>&#xA0;and other sources) is that&#xA0;<em>I only make money when I am doing well</em>. If I don&#x2019;t get results, I don&#x2019;t get to eat. The upside, though, is that a perfectly executed article can go on to reach 100k or even 1M people&#x2014;maximum leverage.</p>
<p>This type of work is not for everyone. There is safety among the average&#x2026;</p>
<p>But if you want the challenge, if you want to have a bigger impact on the world, and you enjoy the idea of <em>getting paid for your contribution&#xA0;</em>perhaps a measurable, high-leverage occupation is what&#x2019;s right for you.</p>
