					<p>Today I had a 4-minute layover.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src width="240"></a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">8:44 arrival. 8:48 departure.</div>
<p>Two bullet trains. New station, foreign country. I&#x2019;m running low on sleep. Haven&#x2019;t eaten. The odds are stacked.</p>
<p>Automatic response&#x2014;anxiety, fear, imagination. What if I don&#x2019;t make it? I don&#x2019;t have a backup plan. Oh no.</p>
<p>Stop. Reframe. <em>This is an opportunity.</em></p>
<p>&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is an example of a mini-emergency. In the worst case, you miss your train. The natural reaction most people take is to panic, inject stress hormones into their stress phone, and finish the day (late or not) physically older but no more wise.</p>
<p>But we don&#x2019;t have to do that. Instead, when such a mini-emergency presents itself, take it as a rare opportunity to train your decision-making in high-stress situations. </p>
<p>It will come in handy later.</p>
<h3>Some Benefits of Decision Training</h3>
<div></div>
<p>So as I wait, muscles quivering, for the train door to open. What skills am I training?<br>Some that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-planning.</strong> Before the train even stops. What information is useful to me? My train and car number. Departure time. The name of the train. Destination. I should try to remember these things before I get off.</li>
<li><strong>Information Filtering.</strong> Stations are flooded information. In the moment, can I filter signal from noise to make high-probability decisions under heavy time constraints?</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Decision-making.</strong> I have limited information. Japanese isn&#x2019;t my first language. Do I go left or right? Up or down? Any error could cause me to miss my train.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you actually make your train so much. Rather, what&#x2019;s important is your ability to take a perceived negative event and reframe it as something positive&#x2014;an opportunity to level up.</p>
<p>Make a habit out of this and all sorts of adversity&#x2014;fatigue, boredom, stress, loneliness&#x2014;transform into positives instead. </p>
<p>Test yourself in the moment. Get feedback. Level up. Then sit back and enjoy the view.</p>
