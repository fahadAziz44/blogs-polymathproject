			</a>
		

					<p>This is a list of mental models I find repeatedly useful.</p>
<p>According to billionaire investor Charlie Munger,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Before the list, a quick look at mental models and why they matter.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a Mental Model?</strong></h2>
<p>Put simply, a mental model is a&#xA0;tool to help us understand the world.</p>
<p>The world is too complex for our brains to deal with. Every second, we are bombarded with millions of bits of information in the form of sights, sounds, tastes and thoughts.&#xA0;We can&#x2019;t process it all, so our brains simplify. Some of this happens automatically, some of it can be trained.</p>
<p>Humans aren&#x2019;t perfect. When we simplify, we take shortcuts. These shortcuts lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>It isn&#x2019;t hard to imagine how these mistakes can cause problems. You might blow your life savings on something you don&#x2019;t understand. You might say something you don&#x2019;t mean and ruin a relationship.</p>
<p>Mental models help calibrate us to reality. By assembling different ways of looking at the world, we are less likely to get stuck in a single form of biased thinking. By understanding the ways people make mistakes, we can use that knowledge to make fewer mistakes ourselves.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s no wonder Charlies Munger calls mental models the key to &#x201C;elementary, worldly wisdom&#x201D;.</p>
<h2>How to Use This List of Mental Models</h2>
<p>Obviously, you won&#x2019;t learn how to use they mental models just by reading or skimming through this list. You&#x2019;ve got to have many, many hours of practice with using these tools in the real world. But I think this list is a good starting place.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve only included tools here that you can understand with little or no mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>I titled this the &#x201C;forever incomplete&#x201D; list because it is. There is no final or complete list of mental models, because mental models are infinite. Instead, what I&#x2019;ll try to include here are&#xA0;<strong>the ones that I find most useful</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h1>List of Mental Models</h1>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the list, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marginal thinking</strong>. The 100th jar of apple cider you drink today is a lot less valuable the the 1st jar of apple cider.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity costs.&#xA0;</strong>Everything has tradeoffs. If I buy an ugly red sports car to impress women, there&#x2019;s a whole bunch of&#xA0;<em>other</em> things I can&#x2019;t buy now.</li>
<li><strong>Pareto Principle / Power Laws.&#xA0;</strong><em>Winner-take-all effects.</em> A few books will make up 80% of the sales in a year. A few people own 80% of the wealth in the world.
<ul>
<li>Related:&#xA0;<strong>Long tail.&#xA0;</strong>You might not be able to compete with Walmart, Amazon, etc. But there are all sorts of little niche pockets that big companies can&#x2019;t bother company or competing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Correlation vs causation.&#xA0;</strong><em>Overweight people seem to eat more meat. Does that mean meat causes obesity?</em></li>
<li><strong>Reversion to the mean.&#xA0;</strong>If you shoot ten more three-pointers than average at your basketball game, it doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re suddenly way, way better at shooting three-pointers. Maybe you&#x2019;re just having a good day. Tomorrow, you might end up shooting just average again. You might be mistaking&#xA0;<em>noise</em> for&#xA0;<em>signal</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Signal vs Noise.&#xA0;</strong>When you&#x2019;ve got a bunch of data, it&#x2019;s very easy to start seeing patterns, shapes, relationships that&#xA0;<em>are not there</em>. You are mistaking noise for signal.</li>
<li><strong>Compounding.&#xA0;</strong>If I put $1000 in a bank account with 10% interest, what&#x2019;s it worth in 30 years? Most people way, way, way underestimate the effects of this in the long term. Also applies to learning new skills, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Autocatalysis. </strong>Munger:<strong>&#xA0;</strong><em>&#x201C;If you get a certain kind of process going in chemistry, it speeds up on its own. So you get this marvelous boost in what you&#x2019;re trying to do that runs on and on. Now, the laws of physics are such that it doesn&#x2019;t run on forever. [&#x2026;] You accomplish A&#x2014;and, all of a sudden, you&#x2019;re getting A + B + C for a while.&#x201D;</em> (Related: momentum, inertia, critical mass )
<ul>
<li><strong>Activation energy.&#xA0;</strong>The minimum amount of energy you need to start a reaction. Useful for thinking about startup costs in business, jumpstarting behavioral change, going viral on the internet, etc. (Related: MED, critical mass)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Half life.&#xA0;</strong>The time it takes for a value to reach half of it&#x2019;s original.</li>
<li><strong>Equilibrium.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Backup system.&#xA0;</strong><em>Insurance. Generators.&#xA0;</em></li>
<li><strong>Feedback loops.</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis"><strong>Hormesis.</strong></a>&#xA0;Nothing is inherently bad or good. In small enough doses, something &#x201C;toxic&#x201D; is actually beneficial. Examples include exercise, vegetables, alcohol, radiation, etc. (Related: antifragility)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation">Supercompensation.</a></strong> Periods of stress followed by rest can accelerate growth. (Related: progressive overload, post-traumatic growth)</li>
<li><strong>Homeostasis.&#xA0;</strong>(Related: set point)</li>
<li><strong>Evolution.&#xA0;</strong>(Related: competition, creative destruction)</li>
<li><strong>Atrophy.&#xA0;</strong><em>Use it or lose it</em>. (Related: memory, generation effect, aging)</li>
<li><strong>Acute vs chronic stressors.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">Falsifiability</a>. </strong>Statements that can be proven false called &#x201C;falsifiable&#x201D;. Only these statements can be considered scientific. <em>Note: This is the OPPOSITE of what we learn in school.</em>&#xA0;(Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem">demarcation problem</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thinking About Thinking</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hedgehog-fox distinction.&#xA0;</strong>People who can see a single phenomenon in multiple ways make better decisions, are more emotionally robust, etc. (See <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/mental-models-dragonfloxes-and-how-to-think-real-good/">Mental Models, Dragonfloxes, and How to Think Real Good</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Categories of thought.&#xA0;</strong>Why is a chair a chair? It&#x2019;s just a bunch of atoms. It&#x2019;s a chair because you&#xA0;<em>see</em> it that way, and your brain</li>
</ul>
<h2>Humans &amp; Human Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The elephant-rider distinction.</strong>&#xA0;<em>Aka: System I vs System II. Dual processing theory.&#xA0;</em>There&#x2019;s our &#x201C;hot&#x201D;, fast-thinking animal brain and our &#x201C;cold&#x201D; logical rational brain. Both of these are useful. The challenge is figuring out when and how to use each of them.</li>
<li><strong>Tantalus problem.&#xA0;</strong>Humans adapt to a lot of what they&#x2019;re exposed to. Doubling your salary&#x2014;especially if it&#x2019;s high&#x2014;may have little effect on how you feel.</li>
<li><strong>Human evolution.&#xA0;</strong>A lot of the things humans do make little sense without the aid of evolutionary theory.
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-deception</strong>. The real reason we do things can be different from why we&#xA0;<em>think</em> we do things. To help deceive others, it sometimes help to deceive ourselves first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nuding / Environmental Design.&#xA0;</strong>The environment influences our actions/behavior a lot more than we think. So you can alter the environment ( city planning, classroom structure, incentives, etc.) to change the decisions people make&#xA0;<em>without having to rely on willpower</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Groupthink.&#xA0;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Steel vs straw man.</strong>&#xA0;Most of us take the weakest version of an opponent&#x2019;s argument and attack that. Correct thing to do: Take the&#xA0;<em>best, most-formidable</em> version, and then try to deconstruct/destroy that. (See <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/the-ideological-turing-test-how-to-be-less-wrong/">The Ideological Turing Test</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A World We Don&#x2019;t Understand</strong></h2>
<p>The world is really complex and we don&#x2019;t have all the information. Here are some concepts that help us make decision/understand the world when there is incomplete information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-Naive Precautionary Principle.&#xA0;</strong>If a lot is at stake (e.g. the fate of humanity), you want to tread really, really carefully and make sure you have a lot of supporting evidence that you wont&#x2019; die before making any changes that could wipe you out. This is &#x201C;non-naive&#x201D; because it doesn&#x2019;t apply to situations where the probabilities are known, the risks aren&#x2019;t fatal, etc. (&#x201C;How can you cross the street&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll end up hit by a car?!&#x201D;)</li>
<li><strong>Chesterton&#x2019;s fence.&#xA0;</strong>Don&#x2019;t tear down a fence until you know why it was put up. The reasons for some traditions, practices, belief systems may not be clear,&#xA0;<em>even to the people who hold/practice them</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Counterfactual thinking.&#xA0;</strong>History isn&#x2019;t like the laboratory&#x2014;stuff happens only once. This means it&#x2019;s really hard to ask, &#x201C;Did Winston Churchill make the right decision?&#x201D; A good outcome doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that the decision was correct.</li>
<li><strong>Campbell&#x2019;s law.&#xA0;</strong>Once you make a set of rules for something (SAT tests, certifications, peer-review, scientific method, etc.) people will&#xA0;<em>always</em> find a way to game the system.</li>
<li><strong>Serendipity.&#xA0;</strong><em>Penicillin</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Perverse incentives.&#xA0;</strong>Paying people to kill snakes may actually cause them to breed&#xA0;<em>more</em> snakes so they can up their paychecks. Incentives to encourage certain actions may actually backfire leading to unexpected negative consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Reductionism</strong>. Breaking things apart and trying to understand the whole by understanding each of the parts. Does not always work, because some features can only be observed holistically.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">Emergence.</a>&#xA0;</strong>Molecules are not alive but organisms are.&#xA0;In complex systems, bigger parts can take on traits that the smaller parts don&#x2019;t have.</li>
<li><strong>Cargo cult science.&#xA0;</strong>It looks like science. Tastes and smells like science. But it&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>not science</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Scientism.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Moral hazard.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle-agent problems.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Paradigm shift.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Skin in the game.&#xA0;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Optionality.&#xA0;</strong><em>&#x201C;Leave doors open.&#x201D;</em></li>
<li><strong>The expert problem.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blue ocean vs. red ocean.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Disruptive technologies.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reverse engineering.</strong></li>
<li><strong>MVP.&#xA0;</strong>Stands for &#x201C;Minimum Viable Product&#x201D;.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage.&#xA0;</strong>Making money by eliminating inefficiencies in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Comparative advantage.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zero-sum vs Positive-sum.&#xA0;</strong>In zero-sum games, you&#x2019;re all fighting for the same pie. In positive-sum games, the pie can keep growing.</li>
<li><strong>Economies of scale.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diseconomies of scale.&#xA0;</strong>The reverse of the above. There are certain things that become more efficient as you &#x201C;scale up&#x201D;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Lucretius Problem</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.y1rans26q">The Minority Rule</a>.</strong> &#x201C;All it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly.&#x201D; Examples include halal or organic food, Christianity, language, etc.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order">Spontaneous order.</a>&#xA0;</strong>Nobody tells my local coffee shop how many donuts to stock in the morning.&#xA0;Complex systems can take on structure without (or with minimal) top-down central planning. Examples: markets, cities, your cell walls, etc.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd">Wisdom of the crowd.</a>&#xA0;</strong>The collected judgments of a group can be more accurate than the judgment of an individual.</li>
<li><strong>Order effects.&#xA0;</strong>You can&#x2019;t just consider the result of a particular choice or action. You also have to think of the outcome of the outcome. And then you have to consider the outcome of the outcome of the outcome&#x2026;</li>
<li><strong>Wicked problems.&#xA0;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Butterfly effect.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Misinterpretation of p-values.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Curse of knowledge.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ludic fallacy.&#xA0;</strong>Mistaking games for real life. In real life, rules, probabilities, possible moves, etc. are not clear, and this changes how you can and should go aobut decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Lucifer effect.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Top down vs bottom up.</strong></li>
</ul>
