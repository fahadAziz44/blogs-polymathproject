					<p>What does it take for self-publishers to hit the bestsellers lists?</p>
<p>I mentioned recently that I&#x2019;m thinking of self-publishing a book.</p>
<p>Readers thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>So I&#x2019;m probably going to write one. And if I&#x2019;m going to write one, of course I&#x2019;m going to aim for the bestseller lists.</p>
<p>To do that, I need to understand <em>how the system works.</em></p>
<p>These aren&#x2019;t just notes&#x2014;they&#x2019;re also a look at how I might reverse engineer a particular objective. A blind coin flip (that lands on tails 99% of the time) is not the only way to do a book launch.</p>
<p>The book will happen 9+ months in the future, but the framework gets build <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>What that means is I&#x2019;m:</p>
<ol>
<li>Taking loads of notes on the subject</li>
<li>Doing a feasibility analysis (Are people interested? How much will it cost (time and money)? How soon can I publish? What is the industry like? What are the big mistakes? etc.)</li>
<li>Drafting up a plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#x2019;s dig in&#x2026;</p>
<h1>What are the major lists? How are rankings determined?</h1>
<p>The first thing to realize is that <strong>the term &#x2018;bestselling&#x2019; is a lie.</strong> You can sell 10x what books on the list sell and not make the list.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s look at each of the top 4 lists.</p>
<h2>The New York Times</h2>
<ul>
<li>Separated into 20 weekly and 3 monthly lists</li>
<li>They are elitist and selective. Rankings are calculated with private &#x201C;polling&#x201D; of a proprietary list of publishers</li>
<li>The selection is particularly harsh for &#x201C;advice&#x201D; nonfiction books</li>
<li>Ebook sales not counted for those nonfiction books</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Takeaway: This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make the list with a self-published book. The NYT is off our radar.</em></p>
<h2>The Wall Street Journal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Weekly list</li>
<li>Lists split into fiction, nonfiction and business
<ul>
<li>Separate lists for physical and ebook</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They get fair data from all major physical and digital sellers (except Apple) using Nielsen BookScan reporting</li>
<li>They exclude e-books that are free or less than $0.99</li>
<li>Audiobooks are excluded</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Takeaway: Much fairer than the Times. We can just focus on sales without worrying about funny business.</em></p>
<h2>USA Today</h2>
<p>Least prestigious of the three lists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly list</li>
<li>Lumps all books together into one category.</li>
<li>If you hit the Wall Street Journal list, you&#x2019;ll probably hit this.</li>
<li>Counting goes from Monday to Sunday</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Takeaway: We can ignore this and focus on WSJ only&#x2014;they use similar metrics and we will likely hit both at the same time.</em></p>
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<ul>
<li>Based purely off of Amazon sales</li>
<li>Private algorithm that nobody knows about</li>
<li>Rankings determined off hourly sales
<ul>
<li>It&#x2019;s counterproductive to concentrate sales in the same hour. It will drop rankings in other hour frames.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Takeaway: Amazon rankings are only affected by Amazon sales. But the reverse is not true&#x2014;Amazon sales still affect WSJ rankings.</em></p>
<h1>What does it take to hit the lists?</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>The New York Times</strong> &#x2014; To hit the list, you&#x2019;ll need a publishing deal, at least 18 months and somewhere from 5,000-10,000 book sales. Remember, ebooks don&#x2019;t cont.
<ul>
<li>This is out for self-published authors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> &#x2014; Get 3,000 to 5,000 sales, and you&#x2019;re in. No funny business.</li>
<li><strong>USA Today</strong> &#x2014; Similar to WSJ.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> &#x2014; It takes about 2000 sales in a day to hit the Amazon Top 10. These are only sales on the Amazon platform.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to Hit the Lists</h1>
<p>With the above information in hand, it&#x2019;s clear what it takes to hit all of the bestseller lists.</p>
<ol>
<li>Concentrate on Amazon sales</li>
<li>Launch the book on Monday or Tuesday</li>
<li>Sell 5000 books in the first week
<ul>
<li>Plan for failures by setting milestones for 10-20k sales</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#x2019;s it. Two steps.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s all for the self-publishing notes.</p>
<p>For the next stage, I&#x2019;ll be looking at how to realistically get 10-20k preorders on Amazon.</p>
<p>Some questions I&#x2019;ll be asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big of a community do I need?
<ul>
<li>What percentage of &#x2018;fans&#x2019; tend to purchase books?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How much traffic to A-list blogs get in a week?
<ul>
<li>What percentage of A-list blog readers end up purchasing books?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: As a very, very rough estimate, I&#x2019;m looking at 100k &#x2018;fans&#x2019; on the blog through email, social media, etc. and then another 150k of outreach during the first week of the launch.</em></p>
