					<p>EDIT: The $1000 Publishing Challenge is Now Finished! The results and lessons learned are below. Scroll down further for the initial challenge rules.</p>
<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<p>In late 2016, I bet my readers $1000 that I could publish every day for 30 days straight. The main motivation of the challenge was to conquer my fear of publishing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The good stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>I successfully completed 30/30 days of the challenge</li>
<li>Over 4000 new readers joined my weekly newsletter,&#xA0;<a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/theopencircle">The Open Circle</a>. This more than doubled readership from before the challenge started.</li>
<li>Two of my popular articles were syndicated to the <a href="http://observer.com/author/charles-chu/">New York Observer</a>.</li>
<li>I syndicated many of the same articles to&#xA0;<a href="https://medium.com/@mmeditations">Medium</a>, earning over 140,000 reads and several thousand followers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall post quality dropped from the pressure of publishing every day. But, despite my fear, my readers didn&#x2019;t all abandon me and stop reading.</li>
<li>The time I spent on writing took away from other projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>I&#x2019;m less afraid of the publish button.</strong> The main goal of the challenge was to get over the fear of making my writing public. Before I did this, I thought that a single bad post would send readers scrambling to block me for life. I imagined my inbox flooded with hate mail. I got a bit of hate mail, but most of the stuff was positive.</li>
<li><strong>I have a better idea of my real writing output.</strong> When I designed this challenge, I was genuinely worried whether I could write 500 words a day. Now I know that I can pump out 2000+ words in a single hour if I have the right conditions set up.</li>
<li><strong>I found my optimal writing hours.</strong> There seem to be two ideal writing blocks for me: (1) the first 2-3 hours of the morning and (2) the last 2-3 hours before deadline.</li>
<li><strong>I discovered the importance of environment.</strong> For me, the ideal conditions for a large number of good ideas are: (1) a space with other people, (2) no WiFi access and (3) boredom. My highest output day actually happened on a flight to Singapore.</li>
<li><strong>Always outline first.</strong> Even 10 minutes spent writing it out can save hours in failed pieces and dead ends later.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How I Would Change Things</h1>
<p>I think the challenge was 90% a success.</p>
<p>If I were to repeat the challenge, here are a few tweaks I would make:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set the &#x201C;end of day&#x201D; cutoff earlier.</strong> I set mine to midnight. That was a bad idea for sleep. If I could restart, I would set it to 8 pm.</li>
<li><strong>Set a lower word count.</strong> The point of the challenge is to <em>press publish</em>. It&#x2019;s okay to write a shorter piece. There were several times where I said everything I needed to say, but hadn&#x2019;t hit 500 words. I was forced to either add &#x201C;fluff&#x201D; or discard the piece.</li>
<li><strong>Consider banning quotes.</strong> If you set a word goal of 500, it&#x2019;s easy to just get a bunch of quotes from other sources to help meet your word count. I did this several times.</li>
<li><strong>Write in two sessions.</strong> On the best days, I wrote the draft first and then went to do something else. I then did a second session with editing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Onwards to the next challenge!</p>
<p><em>The original challenge info can be found below.</em></p>
<h1>Original Challenge Post</h1>
<p>I hate the publish button.</p>
<p>Click it&#x2026;and&#xA0;<em>whoosh</em>, your work is naked to thousands of judging eyes. It&#x2019;s damn scary<em>. </em>So, I write and&#xA0;don&#x2019;t publish. I kill 4 out of 5 of my drafts&#x2014;they never live to see the click.</p>
<p>But it&#x2019;s not my writing that needs killing. It&#x2019;s something else.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s <em>procrastination</em>.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s high time I crushed this fear of public failure. To do this, I&#x2019;m making myself an offer I can&#x2019;t refuse: <strong>If I can&#x2019;t publish 500 words a day for 30 days, I will pay you $1000.</strong></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s right, I&#x2019;m asking you, my reader,&#xA0;to help kill my fear of publishing.</p>
<p>Interested? I&#x2019;ve drafted the challenge rules below.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you&#x2019;re only interested in the psychological backing and experiment design, skip down to the FAQ section.</em></p>
<h1>The Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>Every day, before noon EST (which is midnight here in Thailand), I will publish a post on my <a href="http://fb.me/marketmeditations">Facebook page</a> with a link to something I published that day.</li>
<li>This can be on my blog or for any other platform I write on (guest post, magazines, Medium, Quora, etc.)</li>
<li>The post has to be at least 500 words.</li>
<li>If I fail to post on <em>any day</em> for the next 30 days (Nov 15 &#x2013; Dec 14, 2016), I will pay $1000 to whoever catches me.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to Take My Money</h1>
<ul>
<li>If I don&#x2019;t provide a link to a published article on my <a href="http://fb.me/marketmeditations">Facebook page</a> by noon EST, message me (Facebook or email) telling me I&#x2019;ve failed.</li>
<li>I&#x2019;ll send the money at random to one of the people who catch me within the first 24 hours. (But I&#x2019;m probably not going to fail)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: You must have a PayPal account to be eligible. Also, I reserve the right the void my own punishment in the event of (1) family emergency and (2) extreme personal illness.</em></p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<p>A few reasons:<br>
* I want to make a statement about human possibilities. With the correct approach humans are <em>capable</em> of way more than the average person believes.<br>
* I want to crush my fear of publishing (aka fear of failure).<br>
* I want to &#x201C;upgrade&#x201D; my consistent writing habit (which I&#x2019;ve been doing for almost 3 years now) into a consistent publishing habit.<br>
* I get a dozen new ideas for each article I publish, and this has built a giant backlog of post ideas. I&#x2019;d like to start tackling some of these.</p>
<h3>Why did you design the challenge in this way?</h3>
<p>The experiment uses two powerful psychological drivers: loss aversion (losing $1000) and social pressure (letting down my readers AND looking stupid). Basically, I&#x2019;ve raised the financial and social stakes so high that I wouldn&#x2019;t ever want to fail.</p>
<h3>How do you have the time for this?</h3>
<p>I&#x2019;ve set up my life so that I only spend less than 1 hour a day on income generation. The rest of the my time goes to passion projects and silly experiments.</p>
<h3>Are you rich?</h3>
<p>No, $1000 is 5-6 weeks of living costs for me (I spend $700-$800 a month here in Thailand). But for this challenge to work, I need to make the risks <em>real</em>.</p>
<h3>Will you actually pay me if you fail?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you&#x2019;ll just have to take my word for it.</p>
<h3>Can I join?</h3>
<p>Sure. Send me an email at charles {at} marketmeditations {dot} com, and we&#x2019;ll talk about a way to set up an accountability circle.</p>
