					<p>There&#x2019;s a&#xA0;legend about Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>There was a certain knot in the city of Gordium. An ancient oracle prophesized that the one to loosen it would be destined to rule over all of Asia.</p>
<p>Historian Peter Green tells the story of Alex his acclaimed <a href="http://amzn.to/2pwpHws">Alexander of Macedon</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;In Gordium, by the temple of Zeus Basileus, [Alexander] found what he sought. This was an ancient waggon [with] one very odd feature: its yoke was fastened to the pole with numerous thongs of cornel-bark, in a complex multiple knot of the kind known by sailors as a Turk&#x2019;s-head. <strong>An ancient oracle had foretold that anyone who contrived to loose this knot would become lord of all Asia.</strong> This was a challenge which Alexander found irresistible.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>At first, Alexander struggles:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;One characteristic of a Turk&#x2019;s-head knot is that it leaves no loose ends visible. For a long while Alexander struggled with this labyrinthine tangle, but to little effect. At last he gave up, &#x2018;at a loss how to proceed&#x2019;. A failure would have been the worst possible propaganda: something drastic had to be done.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, the stuff of legend:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;Alexander, exclaiming &#x2018;What difference does it make how I loose it?&#x2019;d drew his sword and slashed through the tangle at a single stroke, thus revealing the ends carefully tucked away inside.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, it&#x2019;s better to cut just the not.</p>
<h2>Gordian Knots in Life</h2>
<p>Let&#x2019;s apply this story&#x2014;this <em>mental model</em>&#x2014;to modern life.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m most productive in the morning. This is because I&#x2019;ve set up a powerful system of habits&#x2026; My morning ritual&#x2014;diet, meditation, joint prep, etc.&#x2014;is set up so that I&#x2019;m in the best possible condition to do good work.</p>
<p>As a result, my mornings almost always go well.</p>
<p>Evening, though&#x2026; Evenings&#xA0;are the opposite. I can&#x2019;t quite figure them out.</p>
<p>In the evenings, I&#x2019;m tired. I&#x2019;m low on willpower, probably hungry and feel like I&#x2019;ve done &#x201C;enough.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Because of this weakness, I get caught by wasteful internet time. If I get pulled by social media or YouTube, it may take 4 hours or more to get out. To be honest, many days I&#x2019;m too weak to resist.</p>
<p>Enter the Gordian Knot.</p>
<p>Yes, I <em>could</em> try to track down all the &#x201C;triggers&#x201D; or environmental cues that are making me waste my evenings. Yes, I <em>could</em> try to set up a system of habits that keep me from failing. But&#x2026;</p>
<p>Do you see the problem?</p>
<p>This is a <em>lot</em> of work. It might take a few months to a year to tackle this project. All the willpower spent to untie this knot means less time elsewhere solving other, more important, problems.</p>
<p>So, we cut the knot instead.</p>
<p>Instead of solving the problem, you can take the problem and <em>remove it from your life.</em></p>
<p>Recently, I&#x2019;ve noticed my evenings are much better if:</p>
<ul>
<li>I stay in an AirBnB that doesn&#x2019;t have WiFi (I travel constantly)</li>
<li>I leave my laptop and phone in a locker or friend&#x2019;s house (No access to Internet)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of surfing the web, I&#x2019;ll actually go out to events or spend time with friends.</p>
<p>Similarly, I kept myself from overspending in college by freezing my credit card in a block of ice.</p>
<p>By removing the source of the problem, I cut the knot.</p>
<p>Would it be better to directly work on my media addiction? Of course.</p>
<p>But the world is filled with knots to be untied, and we can&#x2019;t get to all of them. When you don&#x2019;t have the time&#x2014;or the means&#x2014;to sow up a wound, it&#x2019;s okay to cauterize it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you gotta cut the knot.</p>
