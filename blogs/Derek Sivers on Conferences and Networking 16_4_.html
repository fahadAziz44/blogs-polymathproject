					<p>I went through a bunch of Derek Sivers&#x2019;s interviews and extracted the parts about networking, conferences and relationship management.</p>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t know about Derek, he was a former professional musician that sold his company CD Baby for $22 million back in 2008.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s also really, really good at managing his network.The transcripts of all of his interviews are available&#xA0;<a href="https://sivers.org/i">here</a>&#xA0;on his website, free for the taking.</p>
<p>When there&#x2019;s something important that 9 out of 10 people suck at (networking, in this case), <strong>being good at it gives you a tremendous advantage.</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: Not all of the notes come from Derek Sivers. I&#x2019;ve been adding my own touches and updating this as I can.</em></p>
<h2>Why conferences?</h2>
<p>When you&#x2019;re starting out and don&#x2019;t have a lot of contacts, these are a great way to meet like-minded people to collaborate in the future.</p>
<h2>Are conferences worth the price?</h2>
<p>Figure it out by calculating conference value.</p>
<p>Tim Ferriss sold his first NYT bestseller (the 4HWW) mainly from live networking with A-list bloggers at conferences like SXSW.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s his thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Say the lifetime value of a subscriber is $2</li>
<li>Say a guest post with an A-list blogger is worth 200 new subscribers</li>
<li>Each successful follow-up is worth $2 x 200 = $400</li>
<li>If the costs for a conference are $2000, you only need to succeed 5 times (out of hundreds of new connections)</li>
</ul>
<p>Still too poor? See <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-replicate-a-3-000-conference-experience-for-free-48647a142ddb#.vyup5pntx">this article</a> on how to get into conferences for free.</p>
<h2>How to find conferences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Google fu &#x2013; search for &#x201C;best conferences in NICHE NAME&#x201D;. For example, &#x201C;best conferences in tech&#x201D; would give you SXSW, TechCrunch, etc.</li>
<li>Ask on popular Q&amp;A sites like Reddit or Quora in the niche of your choice (tech, academia, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to work a conference</h2>
<p>Derek Sivers&#x2014;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no reason to spend a single dollar or a minute of your life attending a conference, unless you do the work of walking up to strangers and getting to know them. Listening to them and not just using them as a sounding board for you to spew your crap into, but actually, you know, opening your mind and ears and listening to them and getting to know them and then following-up afterwards. If you don&#x2019;t do that, it&#x2019;s a total waste of time.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<h3>1. Break the ice</h3>
<p>This is the hardest part. <strong>But this is why you can succeed</strong>. Having the ability to go up to people and say &#x201C;Hi&#x201D; gives you a tremendous advantage.</p>
<h3>2. Get their info</h3>
<p>See the notes on conversation skills elsewhere.</p>
<h3>3. Followup (IMPORTANT)</h3>
<p>You might get 100 business cards from a single conference, but it doesn&#x2019;t matter AT ALL if you don&#x2019;t follow up. That&#x2019;s $1000 dollars blown.</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, people don&#x2019;t do the follow-up.</p>
<p>Derek Sivers&#x2014;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;I think the follow-up is just everything. [&#x2026;] I think I started going to conferences when I was 19 or 20, I would just go to every conference I could and I would meet everybody I could and <strong>the most important thing is I would take every single business card back to my hotel room that night and type it all into my computer and send them a follow-up email</strong> [with a memorable comment] to kind of help them remember who I am.</p></blockquote>
