					<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Half a year ago, I deleted 80% of my friends on Facebook.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
It was a good decision.<p></p>
<p>Our closest friends, our inner circle, are often the biggest influence on our lives.</p>
<p>Well, it&#x2019;s not just friends. It&#x2019;s <em>all</em> the people we spend time with&#x2014;family members, coworkers, friends and spouses.</p>
<p>My favorite quote of all time&#x2014;</p></div>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.&#x201D; &#x2014;Jim Rohn</p></blockquote>
<p>If <em>who</em> we surround ourselves with is so important, we wouldn&#x2019;t want to leave it to chance, would we?</p>
<p>Yet, that&#x2019;s what people do.</p>
<p>I write about all sorts of nerdiness on <em>Market Meditations</em>, but the main theme stays the same: <strong>uncommon methods lead to uncommon success.</strong><br>
<strong><br>
</strong>Don&#x2019;t leave your closest influences up to chance.</p>
<p>Take the reigns&#x2014;<em>choose your inner circle</em><br>
<em><br>
</em></p>
<h1>How Influence Works</h1>
<div></div>
<p>One of my ex-girlfriends was highly emotional.</p>
<p>At first, she seemed normal. And she was beautiful. But as we got closer, I found that her emotions would swing wildly between joy, fury, and abject depression.</p>
<p>I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to end it (it was my first serious relationship). Things got worse. It started to affect me. My emotions were mirroring hers.</p>
<p>I threw my smartphone into a pond. I cried at Disney movies. I wasted my savings. Good things happened too. I smiled at strangers more. I started giving out hugs. I learned to like cats.</p>
<p>Who you spend time with matters.</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t leave it up to chance.</p>
<p>Here are the mechanisms behind it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acclimation.</strong> We adjust our reference point to the standards and actions of those around us. If your inner circle friends are shoveling deep-fried horse-poo into their mouths&#x2026; Well, you might be inclined to do so too.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social pressures.</strong> You want to take the high road, but your &#x2018;friends&#x2019; are raring go out for a binge on beer&#x2026; In that kind of negative environment, it&#x2019;s hard to say, &#x201C;Sorry, I&#x2019;m gonna stay at home and read <em>War and Peace</em> instead.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comradery</strong> For motivation, it&#x2019;s important to have a <em>tribe</em>&#x2014;a group of like-minded people with similar goals and interests. If your circle isn&#x2019;t part of your tribe, you&#x2019;ve got a conflict of interests.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>One of the best ways to lose weight is to remove all temptations from the house. It&#x2019;s the same with friends.</p>
<p>With careful planning, we can craft the right environment for a proper inner circle to develop.</p>
<p>How to start using this in your own life?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delete or distance negative people<br>
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add positive people.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div><b>&#xA0;</b></div>
<h1>Delete or Distance Negative People</h1>
<div></div>
<p>As I always say, <em>subtract before you add.</em> Start filtering out the 20% of friends that are producing the 80% of negative effects on your life.</p>
<p>This is easier for friendships. It&#x2019;s much harder for work and family.</p>
<p>But there <em>are</em> steps you can take&#x2026;</p>
<h2>The Great Facebook Purge</h2>
<div></div>
<p>Half a year ago, I deleted 80% of my Facebook friends.</p>
<p>I wanted a clean slate of people who resonated with my work. People who I could make better and who would make me better in return.</p>
<p>I went through and scored each &#x2018;friend&#x2019; on a scale of 1 to 5 for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Relevancy.</strong> How in line is person X with my vision, my philosophy and my goals? Will they help me get where I want to go? Or, will they hold me back?</li>
<li><strong>Intimacy</strong> How close am I with this person? Will they fly halfway around the world with me? Will they even pick up the phone if I call?</li>
</ol>
<div></div>
<p>Anybody with a 4 or less was deleted.</p>
<p>Why this works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It reduces information overload.</strong> You don&#x2019;t want your feed clogged with people who are sharing &#x201C;booty enhancement&#x201D; ads and listicles all the time. Distill down to the people who are broadcasting interesting work.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>It helps you focus.</strong> You restrict your social &#x201C;signal&#x201D; to people who matter in your life. This let&#x2019;s you broadcast in a more focused way, which attracts closer friends.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>It removes negativity.</strong> By removing trolls and haters that give non-constructive criticism, you remove potential sources of negative momentum.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>The above is low-risk exercise for figuring out who matters, who doesn&#x2019;t, and who absolutely needs to go. It help with the ego, too&#x2014;your friend count is <em>not</em> a representation of your value.</p>
<p>Now, applications to real life.</p>
<h2>How to Distance Yourself</h2>
<p>You can repeat the above exercise with your friends, family and coworkers.</p>
<p>Make a list of people you need to distance yourself from. There&#x2019;s no need for dynamite when diplomacy will do. Don&#x2019;t be confrontational unless you absolutely have to.</p>
<p>Some things you can try&#x2026;</p>
<p><strong>Friends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Naturally distance yourself.</strong> Create reasons not to meet up as frequently. This doesn&#x2019;t mean lying; actually add interesting, different activities to your life (dance, workouts, public speaking, etc.) and slowly move on to building friendships with other people.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell it straight</strong> If your friends sense that you are changing and challenges you. Tell it to them straight. You are changing and they are in your way. It&#x2019;s a litmus test: If they accept the criticism and try to adapt, they&#x2019;re a good friend. If they become angry and confrontational, that&#x2019;s another signal to end things.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p><strong>At Work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talk with the boss.</strong> This only works if your boss doesn&#x2019;t suck. Tell them that person X or environment Y is affecting your ability to do good work. Try to work out a solution. Maybe get transferred.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan an escape.</strong> If everyone at work sucks, you need an <em>escape plan.</em> Start applying for other jobs. Or start a side project. No skills? Acquire them. <strong>You can become decent at most things in 6-12 months.</strong> Get out ASAP.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Family</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be honest.</strong> If you can&#x2019;t honestly tell a loved one what you&#x2019;re doing for personal change, that&#x2019;s a BIG red flag. This is experience speaking. If there&#x2019;s mutual trust between partners, there should be room for a solution. You can ask to be alone in the morning. Maybe find a few hours on weekends. You can ask your spouse, gf, etc. to work on habits. Who wouldn&#x2019;t quit smoking if they really loved their spouse?</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drastic measures.</strong> If the person bringing you down <em>is</em> your spouse or partner, that&#x2019;s the real difficult decision. I won&#x2019;t say what to do, but you&#x2019;ll have to evaluate what is more important to you. And you&#x2019;ll have to live with the repercussions for the rest of your life. But that&#x2019;s how life is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, that should give you a starting point for cleaning up your environment. Now, <em>how to add good people?</em><br>
<em><br>
</em></p>
<h3>Adding Good People: The Chicken and Egg Problem</h3>
<div></div>
<p>Okay, deletion is fairly easy. You determine who is hurting you, and you phase them out.</p>
<p>But what about new friends? How do you find people of excellence to surround yourself with?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>character</strong>. It&#x2019;s a lot easier to meet people if you make them feel good and provide value to their lives.</p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s the great conundrum no? You started this change in order to improve your character. And now you need a better character to meet others&#x2026;</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll be writing more on character reprogramming in the future.</p>
<p>But luckily, there&#x2019;s an immediate answer for now&#x2026;</p>
<h1>Find Them in Books</h1>
<div></div>
<p>There are not a lot of phenomenal people out there. There may be none in your immediate environment. Luckily, there&#x2019;s one place you&#x2019;ll find them in great numbers.</p>
<p>Through books, you can share in the minds of smartest, most honorable and most creative minds in history.</p>
<p>This is what I did when I was stuck in a dead-end job with dead-end social options. I withdrew into my books.</p>
<p>Here are four of my greatest influences to get you started&#x2014;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979680?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmeditations-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0812979680">Antifragile</a></em> by Nassim Taleb.</strong> Millionaire trader, philosopher, writer and weightlifter.

Did I mention he won the Nobel Prize in physics?</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>

The father of the modern essay. Honest and inquisitive, he seems to cover every aspect of human nature in his wandering writings, but he always comes back to one core lesson: be skeptical&#x2014;think for yourself.</li>
