					<p>Cognitive dissonance is poison for the mind. When faced with conflicting decisions and evidence, our minds can become trapped in an eternal cycle -go left or go right? Instead, we go nowhere at all. We go from rational to emotional and start making errors. High-level thinkers must identify cognitive dissonance and move to counter it.<span></span></p>
<p>This is especially true for traders. Many traders are hooked up to information flow that comes in 24/7 in an unending stream. There are a dozen ways to interpret the same piece of news (noise) that can then go to affect any of another dozen mental models. End result? Overcomplexity, frustration and poor decision-making.</p>
<p>By the time you reach cognitive dissonance / overcomplexity, it is too late. You need to step back and do a <b>mental reset</b>&#xA0;-clear the mind and start over fresh. Like we reset a computer, we can reset our minds to try and wipe out some of the cognitive clutter than is affecting our decision making.</p>
<p>When I feel that I am compromised, I shut down my computer and try one of several mental reset exercises.</p>
<p>Some things I have been playing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breathing exercises (Vipassana-style)</li>
<li>Picking up heavy things at the gym&#xA0;+ loud music (surprisingly therapeutic)</li>
<li>Long walks (nowadays, 2-3 hours walking is the norm)</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>At first, you may think that these &#x201C;waste time&#x201D;. Think again. Any time you put into these will pay dividends by improving the time you do spend in your core discipline. Spend an hour on a mental reset to make back what could be a dozen hours of quality decision making later&#x2026;a simple tradeoff.</div>
