<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This Week&#x2019;s Focus Time: <b>4.43 hours per day.</b></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Last Week&#x2019;s Focus Time: <b>3.56 hours per day.</b></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b><br></b></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">We managed a 24% increase on last week. However, because of travel, training time dropped dramatically (to around 30 minutes a day). Meanwhile, focused computer time nearly doubled to an average of 4+ hours a day.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<h2 style="clear: both; text-align: left;">What did we learn?</h2>
<div></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<ul>
<li><b>I&#x2019;m more aware of my mind wandering.</b>&#xA0;Spreadsheet tracking seems to function as a kind of mindfulness training. Before it would take hours sometimes to catch myself distracted. And, even then, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to bring myself back on track. In the last few days, I&#x2019;ve had the catch happen within minutes and bring myself back on course.</li>
<li><b>Decisions about food are a HUGE willpower drain.</b>&#xA0;I was on the road this week and spent a lot of energy evaluating food choices, finding good places to eat, etc. This was a huge drain on willpower, and several times I found myself so tired that I wasn&#x2019;t able to resist. On the spreadsheet, you can see a binge several days this week with 300-400 grams of carbs.&#xA0;</li>
<li><b>Naming your problem areas does help.</b>&#xA0;After identifying that my biggest problem area is the evening, I&#x2019;ve been better about not blindly wasting 3-4 hours a night. This is without any significant structure, though I plan to add this in for this week&#x2019;s objectives.</li>
<li><b>Motivation matters a lot.</b>&#xA0;If I&#x2019;m not &#x201C;Hell Yes!&#x201D; about a project, I might lose focus within 20-30 minutes. If it&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;m super-excited about, I find I can focus for over 2 hours at times.</li>
<li><b>Focus power ramps up slowly. </b>My average focus time went up 30 minutes this week. It also went up 30 minutes last week. Not nearly enough to extrapolate, but I suspect that this gradual change will continul (albeit slower). Two reasons for this slow change: (1) the willpower &#x201C;muscle&#x201D; of the brain adapts slowly and (2) improvements that come from general lifestyle changes happen gradually week on week.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What&#x2019;s changing for next week? Why?</h2>
<div></div>
<p>Radical results require radical action. While I&#x2019;m still working on the fundamentals (not spending time on useless activity, planning, outlining, goal-setting, etc.), this week I also want to play with some less mainstream techniques for behavioral change.</p>
<h3><b>&#x201C;Virtues&#x201D; checklist.</b></h3>
<div><b></b>This is the change I&#x2019;m most excited about. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about how to create changes in &#x201C;character&#x201D; &#x2013; something traditionally believed to be innate / unchangeable.&#xA0;The process I&#x2019;m testing tries to (1) meditate on what virtues I want to represent, (2) make them black and white as possible, and (3) repeatedly make directions that &#x201C;habituate&#x201D; us in that direction.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I chose three &#x201C;virtues&#x201D; I want to focus on for this week:<p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Spiritual</b>&#xA0;&#x2013; Being over-rational has some tradeoffs. I&#x2019;m trying to spend some time doing things without purpose to help balance this out.</li>
<li><b>Smile</b>&#xA0;&#x2013; Did I make someone else smile today? Hopefully this will protect me from isolation and also habituate me to providing happiness for others.</li>
<li><b>Fortitude </b>&#x2013; Willpower is a trainable muscle. I&#x2019;m trying to take negative situations that come across in life and reframe them as a challenge to my willpower.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div></div>
<h3><b>Three focus sessions instead of two.&#xA0;</b></h3>
</div>
<div>I&#x2019;ve been doing some research into circadian rhythms and focus cycles. There tends to be a 5-hour dip midday where performance is reliably lower than the other two. This week I want to divide my 16 waking hours into 6-5-5 blocks and see how my ability to do good work fluctuates within these.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I have subjectively felt a dip in energy during the midday, and, if this is something I see happening this week, maybe I can design my midday to build around this fall in energy. I could do less intensive tasks in the afternoon, take some sort of supplement to keep energy levels high, take naps, etc.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But first we need some data, so I&#x2019;m splitting the day up into triple blocks.</div>
<div><b><br></b></div>
<h3><b>Evening ritual tracking.&#xA0;</b></h3>
<div>Although we had some winners, I still lost 4-5 hours on my worst nights this week. This continues to be my biggest weakness area. To address this, I&#x2019;m going to track several positive habits that might increase the chance of evening success.<p></p>

<div>With those things in mind, this is what the new spreadsheet for Week 4 looks like:</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">It&#x2019;s gonna be another hectic week &#x2013; I&#x2019;m traveling more in Japan before flying to China for a wedding. The goal is the same: ramp up towards double-digit focus.&#xA0;</div>
