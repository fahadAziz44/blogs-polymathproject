					<p>As a bit of ninja training for my mind and writing skills, I like to answer questions on Quora. I&#x2019;ve found directing my writing at a single, visualizable person to be much easier than a vaguely defined audience. I&#x2019;ve included one below that has been a recurring theme of life (and many others, I suspect).</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: large;">How do I stop basing my self-worth on how good I am at something?</span></b></p>
<p>You&#x2019;re asking the wrong question.</p>
<p>What I think you want to ask: <b>&#x201C;How do I stop comparing myself to other people?&#x201D;</b><br>Instead of &#x201C;how good I am&#x201D; in relation to others, look at &#x201C;how good I am&#x201D; in relation to yourself. Getting validation from your own progress (be that in school, work or some skill) is not a bad thing. What makes us suffer is comparison with other people.</p>
<p>Buddhism (and many other religions, philosophies) have been struggling with this problem for&#x2026;forever. So don&#x2019;t think there is an easy answer.</p>
<p>Still, you&#x2019;ve made the first step. You recognize the problem. The next step is to rewire your brain from getting validation from others to getting validation from yourself.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not so good at it yet, but here are a few things that have helped me:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Realize nobody is happy.</b> Social media has made this worse, but all the smiling faces on the Internet make us falsely believe people are happy. Most people aren&#x2019;t: they hate their jobs, they don&#x2019;t think they make enough money, they are worried about being fat, they are lonely&#x2026;and on and on and on.</li>
<ul>
<li>Why look to others for validation if they aren&#x2019;t happy anyway? That&#x2019;s purposely throwing yourself into the fire. Instead, find a few, select role models than you can truly look up to and model yourself after them.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Think long and hard about what YOU want.</b> I&#x2019;ve done this for 10 years. And I do it still. Every. Damn. Day.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you don&#x2019;t know what you want, you will default to wanting what others &#x201C;have,&#x201D; suspicious that what they have is the answer to happiness. It&#x2019;s not. 99% of people are sheep, following each other around because they believe somebody else will tell them the answer to happiness. THEY WON&#x2019;T. Only hard work will tell you where you want to go.</li>
<li>When you&#x2019;re old and dying, what can you look back on and smile at? What things can you do today so that, when you go to bed at night, you can sigh a sigh of satisfaction and say, <i>&#x201C;There is no place I&#x2019;d rather be. There&#x2019;s nothing else I&#x2019;d rather have done. Let&#x2019;s wake up and do it all again.&#x201D; </i>Don&#x2019;t know the answer? Read. Talk to people. Ask questions. When I was lost, I read 200+ books in a single year.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep an internal scorecard</b>. This comes straight from bazillionaire investor Warren Buffett. Measure progress by how much you improve on a day to day basis, not on how skilled you are in relation to others. That&#x2019;s a never-ending circle.</li>
<ul>
<li>You&#x2019;ve already passed the first step: awareness. Now, like a meditator bringing his distracted mind back to a breath, every time you find yourself comparing yourself others, consciously bring your mind back to your internal self. Say to yourself, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s great, Sally makes 100k per year. But am I better today than I was yesterday?&#x201D;</li>
<li>Once you make a habit of personal progress, it becomes an <i>addiction</i>. You want to improve every day. Satisfaction starts to come from inside, not outside.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I got all excited and wrote rapid-fire from my brain&#x2026; Hope it helps. Just remember everyone has this problem, and you are way ahead of 99% of people by realizing that validation from comparison to others is not sustainable (there&#x2019;s always somebody better than you at X).</p>
