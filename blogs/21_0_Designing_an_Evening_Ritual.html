					<p>After tracking time for several weeks now, I find I am by far the least productive in the evening.</p>
<p>Since this is a high impact area (average 3-4 hours lost <em>a day</em>), it needs to be tackled immediately. First, dissect and understand the problem.</p>
<p>Three reasons for poor evening performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower willpower in the evening.</strong> I am tired from all the decisions made throughout the day, and don&#x2019;t have much &#x201C;Mental HP&#x201D; left to make optimal choices.</li>
<li><strong>Deeply ingrained bad habits.</strong> I spent most of my high school and college life on mindless Internet browsing. My mind automatically responds to certain triggers in the bedroom, making me want to waste time.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of stability.</strong> Mornings are naturally stable things. You are always waking up (or, you should be&#x2026;). You always brush your teeth. Evenings don&#x2019;t have a stable &#x201C;start trigger&#x201D; of equal caliber. We need to be more conniving if we want something reliable here.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>Our goal here is to find a way to conquer these problems, eliminating low quality evening time and settings ourselves up for a better day. </p>
<p>Enter the evening ritual.</p>
<h2>Why an evening ritual?</h2>
<p>Rituals are built on habits. Poor evening performance is based on habits.</p>
<p>By &#x201C;re-wiring&#x201D; our evening habits to a premeditated ritual, we can successfully override negative behavior to create high-probability behavioral change.</p>
<p>At its essence, a ritual is a chain of habits &#x2013; the end of one habit triggers the next:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable Trigger</li>
<li>Habit Chain</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
</ol>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Choose a Reliable Trigger</h2>
<div></div>
<p>Triggers are everything for rituals. Once you&#x2019;ve adjusted to a new ritual, all you need is that signal and, <em>snap</em>, like a dog drooling to the sound of a can opener, your body will act smoothly, without effort.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t expect to find the perfect trigger on the first try. Ideally, it should be something that works equally well anywhere in the world and in any environment.</p>
<p>Some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>After dinner &#x2013; use the end of dinner as your start trigger. Works better if you eat meals late enough in the day and at a consistent time.</li>
<li>At Xpm &#x2013; use an alarm set to a certain time in the evening. Works better if most of your days start and end at the same time.</li>
<li>Pre-existing habit &#x2013; use a reliable habit that you already perform. Maybe you take a shower every night. Maybe it&#x2019;s brushing your teeth. Use this habit as a trigger for another habit chain.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>I&#x2019;ll be playing with each of these over the coming weeks to see what works best.</p>
<h2>Make a Habit Chain</h2>
<div></div>
<p>This can be as short as zero things (Trigger, Sleep) or much longer (Trigger, Habit 1, Habit 2, &#x2026; , Sleep).</p>
<p>Each habit in the chain should accomplish an objective.</p>
<p>Some possible objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher sleep quality.</strong> You might decide to dim the lights in the room; reduce blue light exposure; drink some sort of calming tea; listen to music; meditate; etc.</li>
<li><strong>Review the day.</strong> Look back on your objectives for the day? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why? What could you do better? This integrates a habit for repeatedly getting feedback on our own performance.</li>
<li><strong>Plan tomorrow.</strong> I tend to do better when I have a general framework upon waking. By setting up the night before, I am guaranteeing myself this framework.</li>
<li><strong>Clean.</strong> Humans have a harder time making decisions in a cluttered room. Cleaning helps us relax, too. Maybe doing this in the evening will pay off 2x.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, again, I&#x2019;m just throwing ideas out there. The idea is to piece together high-probability activities and see how it contributes to our performance.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s all for today. I&#x2019;ll be integrating this during my next weekly cycle. Let&#x2019;s see how it goes!</p>
