<hr>
<p>Less than two years ago, I published my first blog post.</p>
<p>Before then, I&#x2019;d never published<em>&#xA0;anything</em>. The only writing I&#x2019;d done was in my private journals.</p>
<p>I didn&#x2019;t know if anyone would read my work. I didn&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;d be any good at it. But I took the risk anyway and just did it.</p>
<p>At first, my worries were right. Nobody read my work. And I wasn&#x2019;t any good. But because I stayed consistent, 2017 ended up as one of the best, and most creatively fulfilling, years of my life. I quit my freelancing work, started writing full time, and now get to share ideas with smart people all over the world.</p>
<p>This year, I&#x2019;d like to take another risk:<strong> I want to learn how to write fiction.</strong></p>
<p>I loved stories &#x2013; especially speculative fiction &#x2013; growing up. For about a year now, I&#x2019;ve had this itch to try short story writing. And, if I want to, I know it&#x2019;s gonna involve two things: (1) a lot of practice and (2) a lot of failure.</p>
<p>To help me get through this rough, &#x201C;learning&#x201D; phase,&#xA0; I&#x2019;m launching a learning project.</p>
<p>Enter 100 Rejections.</p>
<h2>100 Rejections</h2>
<p>In 2018, I want to get rejected 100 times.</p>
<p>Ray Bradbury, most famous now for his novel&#xA0;<em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, once advised that writers write one short story a week. Why one story a week? Because &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not possible to write 52 bad short stories in a row.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Practically, this means I want to write a short story every week (52 in a year) and submit them to multiple publications. Short stories, by the way, run somewhere from 1,500 to 7,500 words. Assuming each story gets rejected twice, that&#x2019;s 104 rejections in a year.</p>
<p>I set up this project this way for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not outcome-based</strong>. All I need to do to get a rejection is to submit a story. I can&#x2019;t guarantee whether or not I&#x2019;ll get published, but I can guarantee that I write and submit.</li>
<li><strong>Garbage is okay</strong>. The biggest mental block, for me and many others, is the fear of failure. By setting the goal, from the beginning, to fail and fail a lot, I&#x2019;m less afraid of doing the work.</li>
<li><strong>Fast feedback cycles</strong>. Learning happens best with short cycles of trial-and-error. Short stories can be written and read quickly, which means I get a lot more practice than I would if I wrote, say, novels.</li>
</ul>
<p>My hope is that, after a year of writing bad stories, I&#x2019;ll grow into a much better &#x2013; and consistent &#x2013; writer.</p>
<p>My other hope is that this project will serve as a guide and inspiration for others with similar learning projects. Many people complain that they are too old or too busy to learn something new.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x2019;t have to be that way.</p>
<h2>The System</h2>
<p>Big goals never work. At least, not on their own.</p>
<p>In my weekly newsletter, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s not that most people fail their New Year&#x2019;s Resolutions. It&#x2019;s that most people fail their resolutions, period. Resolutions, like goals, only tell us where we want to go, not how to get there. For that, you need a system.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>So what system do I plan to use?</p>
<p>The most important thing for these kinds of goals is psychology. As long as I keep writing, finishing and submitting stories, I&#x2019;ll get to my goal.</p>
<p>So, my current plan is a series of daily habits and weekly goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write 1000 words a day.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Actively read professional short stories.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Critique amateur short stories.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Join several writing communities and attend regular meetings.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Done well, this should let me learn very quickly by getting feedback from a number of sources (comparing my stories to pro stories, learning how bad stories suck, critical feedback from others on my &#x201C;blind spots,&#x201D; etc.).</p>
<p>What about time?</p>
<p>Ideally, I should be able to get this done on ~1-2 hours a day. This lets me deal with my other obligations (this blog, business stuff, translation, family, etc.) without suffering from overwhelm.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s all for now. Time to get writing.</p>
