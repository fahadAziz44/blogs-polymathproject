					<p>Wow. This blog is officially six months old.</p>
<p>In less than half a year, we&#x2019;ve built an email list of 20,000 readers and get hundreds of thousands of readers each month.</p>
<p>How did this blog grow so fast? Well, mostly because I focused on growth.</p>
<p>But now that we&#x2019;re a decent size, I think it&#x2019;s time for some changes.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s no point in constantly fighting for new readers if I&#x2019;m losing old ones. Somebody who reads just one of my articles doesn&#x2019;t benefit too much in the long run. It makes more sense, then, to focus on&#xA0;<em>deepening relationships with existing readers.</em></p>
<p>To do this, I&#x2019;m making a few test changes in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Blog Post Styles</h2>
<p>Usually, I spend hours trying to get the &#x201C;presentation&#x201D; just right for blog posts. I&#x2019;ll edit, re-edit and re-re-edit the structure of an article to make it the best it can be.</p>
<p>This is great for getting a post to go viral (and reach lots of people). But it doesn&#x2019;t help my serious readers&#x2014;they always read everything I write carefully.</p>
<p>All the time spent on presentation means less time to do other things.</p>
<p>As a result, I have a backlog of ideas that (1) I don&#x2019;t have the time to write about and (2) are to &#x201C;nerdy&#x201D; to resonate with a wide audience.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, in addition to &#x201C;regular&#x201D; articles, I&#x2019;ll be writing more nerdy stuff to see if you guys like it.</p>
<h2>Patreon System Updates</h2>
<p>One big goal this year is to make the blog self-sufficient.</p>
<p>This means having everything work without relying on advertising or product sales. This is only possible due to reader support.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/charleschu">patron system</a> has been great for this.</p>
<p>However, the reward tiers that involve boxes of gifts have been a problem.</p>
<p>Two reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anybody can assemble a box of gifts and send it to you</li>
<li>Time I spend shopping is less time spent on reading / writing</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I&#x2019;ll be making some adjustments to the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/charleschu">reward tiers</a> in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve changed the setup to offer monthly video calls, and I&#x2019;ll be adding more tiers with reader feedback.</p>
<h2>One-On-One Coaching</h2>
<p>A lot of people have contacted me acting for help with specific, personal problems.</p>
<p>Until now, two things have kept me away from coaching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many-to-one philosophy.</strong> I thought that writing was the best way to reach as many people as possible. Which is still true. But it&#x2019;s also a terrible way to <em>establish a conversation</em> with you, the reader.</li>
<li><strong>Fear.</strong> Coaching puts me <em>directly</em> responsible for the well-being of one person. And I hate letting people down, so there&#x2019;s a lot of pressure there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, work with a few people in my private life has convinced me that there&#x2019;s nothing better than coaching for people who (1) need serious help or (2) want results fast.</p>
<p>And there&#x2019;s a lot in it for me too, because I find that&#x2014;aside from books&#x2014;I learn the most about human nature via deep conversations with people. Helping you with&#xA0;your specific struggles teaches me about how to help everyone else as well.</p>
<p>For the next quarter, I&#x2019;m trying out a new coaching method of which focuses on giving you the skills to <em>manage yourself</em>.</p>
<p>If interested, send an email to charles {at} marketmeditations {dot} com with the subject line &#x201C;Online Coaching&#x201D;.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Hope that gives you some context on what changes will be happening going forward.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a reader, Charles</p>
