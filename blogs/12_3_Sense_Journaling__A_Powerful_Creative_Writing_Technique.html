					<p>Fiction and non-fiction are both writing, but mastery in one does not equal mastery in the other. Non-fiction tends to be analytical and rational. Fiction, though, goes much closer to our core.</p>
<p>Fiction is about <em>senses</em>.</p>
<p>This is one reason why creative writing is so hard to learn. We spend most of the time in our analytical minds. To write good fiction, we need to <em>unlearn.&#xA0;</em>We need to train ourselves to see the world past memes and cliches and surface patterns.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s where creative writing exercises <em>can</em> be useful.</p>
<p>What follows is an exercise I found in <a href="http://amzn.to/2kAkenf">From Where You Dream</a>, a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Olen Butler.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most journaling is counterproductive. Most journals are repositories of great swatches of abstraction and generalization and self-analysis and interpretation and all that bad stuff. Don&#x2019;t do that. But here&#x2019;s a certain kind of journal that might be useful to you:</p>
<p>At the end of the day or the beginning of the next day, return to some event of the day that evoked an <em>emotion</em> in you. Record that event in the journal. But do this only&#x2014;<em>only</em>&#x2014;moment to moment through the senses. Absolutely never name an emotion; never start explaining or analyzing or interpreting an emotion. Record only through these five ways I mentioned that we feel emotions&#x2014;signals inside the body, signals outside the body, flashes of the past, flashes of the future, sensual selectivity&#x2014;which are therefore the best ways to express emotions. Such a journal entry will read like a passage in a novel, like the most intense moment-to-moment scene in a novel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here it is again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record some emotional event using <em>only</em> moment to moment senses</li>
<li>Do NOT name emotions (&#x201C;I was scared&#x201D;)</li>
<li>Do NOT analyze or interpret (&#x201C;It was a strange feeling&#x201D;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Use only the five ways we feel emotions to do the writing.</p>
<p>The five ways are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signals in the body.</strong> Temperature, heartbeat, lungs, muscles, nerves, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Signals outside the body.</strong> Gestures, posture, facial expressions, tone of voice, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Flashes of the past.</strong> Not analyses but what Butler calls &#x201C;bursts of waking dream.&#x201D;</li>
<li><strong>Flashes of the future.</strong> More dream bursts, but as premonitions of what <em>might</em> happen. Again, not analytical.</li>
<li><strong>Sensual selectivity.</strong> What we sense from the world around us, filtered by the emotions. (The same thing can look very different to two people.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Try doing this consecutively for a few weeks. Butler says you should start slipping into a meditative &#x201C;dreamspace&#x201D; where you can write directly from experience and not from your analytical mind.</p>
