					<p>Today, I&#x2019;m really scared.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s January 1, 2017. Today, I made a big decision. For the next year of my life, I&#x2019;m taking a 90% pay cut to make it as a full-time writer.</p>
<p>First, some background.</p>
<p>Three days ago, I got a message from Benjamin Hardy, one of the top writers on Medium and contributor to Time:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-693 jetpack-lazy-image" src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="Screen Shot 2017-01-01 at 1.21.00 PM.png" width="812" height="304" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-01-at-1.21.00-PM.png?resize=812%2C304"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-693" src="https://i1.wp.com/thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-01-at-1.21.00-PM.png?resize=812%2C304" alt="Screen Shot 2017-01-01 at 1.21.00 PM.png" width="812" height="304" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></p>
<p>I didn&#x2019;t know what to think. After all, I&#x2019;ve only been publishing for a few short months. Suddenly, one of the most successful guys in the business is telling me that I am going to blow up in 2017!</p>
<p>The very next day, I get an email from Chad Grills, editor of The Mission&#x2014;one of the top 3 publications on Medium, with over 200,000 regular readers:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="gmail_msg">I saw my friend recommend your <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/isaac-asimov-how-to-never-run-out-of-ideas-again-b7bf8e09cc91#.hcvd46ldx" target="_blank">latest piece on Asimov</a>&#x2026; it&#x2019;s <i class="gmail_msg">epic</i>! &#xA0;If you&#x2019;d ever like to submit your work, I&#x2019;d be honored to help promote it.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x2019;s when it hit me&#x2014;<em>people like what I write.</em></p>
<h2></h2>

<h2>Why I Write</h2>
<p>Writing is a thankless activity.</p>
<p>Just over three months ago, this blog didn&#x2019;t exist. Yet, since I started, my writing has gone on to reach millions of people.</p>
<p>The secret to my success? I worked my ass off. In these 3 months, <strong>I&#x2019;ve invested over 700 hours into blogging and writing.&#xA0;</strong>As a freelancer, 700 hours would have earned me over $30,000 dollars. As a writer, I didn&#x2019;t even make $300.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m happy to take this pay cut. I&#xA0;<em>want</em> to to take this pay cut.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I believe in the power of ideas.</p>
<h2>The Power of An Idea</h2>
<p>In my lifetime, I&#x2019;ve had exactly three life-changing moments.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t mean life-changing like a new home or a new job. I mean life-changing like the world flips upside down, dumps you on your face and then kicks you while you&#x2019;re down for extra effect.</p>
<p>One of the three was when my girlfriend&#x2014;the girl I was going to marry&#x2014;left me for a one-way ticket to South Korea. I didn&#x2019;t see it coming at all. That event made me re-evaluate everything I thought I knew about the world.</p>
<p>The other two moments weren&#x2019;t events at all. They were <em>ideas.</em></p>
<p>Those two ideas were the reason I decided to quit my 9-5 to become a freelancer. I wanted challenges. I wanted to suffer. I wanted&#xA0;to exist.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, those same ideas are the reason I&#x2019;m quitting freelancing, taking a 90% pay cut, and becoming a full-time writer.</p>
<p>Without those ideas, I would be a completely different person today. I know exactly how a single idea can completely change someone&#x2019;s life.</p>
<p>Now I want to share that with other people.</p>
<h2>Help&#xA0;Make the Dream Happen</h2>
<p>Writing doesn&#x2019;t pay. That&#x2019;s okay&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t care about money. Last year, I spent less than $15,000 and still managed to launch a blog and travel to 6 different countries.</p>
<p>I want to write because it&#x2019;s the best way I know to help a lot of people.</p>
<p>With that said, I can&#x2019;t run a blog on passion alone. It takes 250+ hours of my time and hundreds of dollars each month to keep the blog running. If I want to do this seriously,&#xA0;the blog has to be sustainable.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s where YOU come in.</p>
<p>Currently, I have 3 months of savings in the bank. In that time, the blog needs to become sustainable.</p>
<p>There are two ways this can happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>I drown the blog in ads and products that you don&#x2019;t need to try&#xA0;and keep the blog afloat.</li>
<li>Readers provide support and, in exchange, I have more time to produce valuable content that improves people&#x2019;s lives.</li>
</ol>
<p>I really, really, really don&#x2019;t want to take the first option.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve launched a campaign on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/charleschu">Patreon</a>. Patreon lets readers provide DIRECT support so I can spend less time trying to sell you stuff you don&#x2019;t need and more time creating content that improves people&#x2019;s lives.</p>
<p>A small investment of your time (in the form of a pledge) will let me reach thousands of extra people each month.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, you&#x2019;ll get access to unique bonuses such as patron-only content, postcards, books I&#x2019;ve read and other esoteric goodies.</p>
<p>PLUS, you&#x2019;ll get the gift of my eternal gratitude. Who can put a price on that?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.patreon.com/charleschu">become a patron</a> here.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading,<br>
Charles</p>
