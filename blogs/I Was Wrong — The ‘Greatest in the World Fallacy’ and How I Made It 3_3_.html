					<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">In the two years since I started writing, hundreds of thousands of people have read my essays. </span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Along the way, I made a lot of errors. And I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll make many more. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>There&#x2019;s one particular mistake I made a lot that I feel guilty about.&#xA0;</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Recently, I&#x2019;ve been calling it the &#x201C;greatest in the world fallacy&#x201D;.</span></span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">How to Sell A Lot of Books</h2>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Here&#x2019;s one version of the greatest in the world fallacy that I see everywhere:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em><span class>&#x201C;To be the best in the world, study the best in the world and do what they do.&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>For a long time, I was convinced this was true.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>To be a successful investor, I thought you could read books by Warren Buffett or George Soros and emulate them. To be an elite basketball player, I thought you could spend nights and weekends watching footage of Lebron James or Kobe Bryant and train like they train.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Or&#x2014;as many self-help books claim&#x2014;I thought you could be successful by imitating the routines of the best in the world:</span></span></p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter jetpack-lazy-image" style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" width="301" height="394" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jkW-GzFiL.jpg?resize=301%2C394&amp;ssl=1"><noscript><img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jkW-GzFiL.jpg?resize=301%2C394&#038;ssl=1" width="301" height="394" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Book sales and headlines don&#x2019;t lie&#x2014;people love this stuff. There&#x2019;s a powerful belief that, if you study the best in the world and imitate them, you can </span><span class><em>become</em></span> like them.</span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>So far, it seems pretty convincing. So what&#x2019;s wrong with it?</span></span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true"><span class>50 Cups of Coffee to Overnight Success: Signal or Noise?</span></h2>
<p><img class=" aligncenter jetpack-lazy-image" style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" width="391" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac_%281842%29_Detail.jpg?resize=391%2C355&amp;ssl=1"><noscript><img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac_%281842%29_Detail.jpg?resize=391%2C355&#038;ssl=1" width="391" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>The first problem is noise. </span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>People do many things, and it&#x2019;s never easy to separate causation from mere correlation. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Balzac, the French novelist and playwright, was known for his maniacal writing habits. He drank somewhere from 30-50 cups of coffee a day, and it was not uncommon for him to write for 15+ hours in a single session.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>I drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day. If I 20x my coffee consumption will I be able to write like good &#x2018;ol Balzac? Of course not. Likewise, Warren Buffett eats McDonalds hamburgers and drinks Coca Cola. Does that mean I should eat like him to invest like him? Again, of course not.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">The above two examples were silly, so it&#x2019;s pretty easy to write them off. It&#x2019;s not always so easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Things like morning meditation, whey protein shakes to boost mental clarity, self-hypnosis, shiatsu massage, and free-association journaling all sound like they <span class><em>could</em></span>&#xA0;be useful. </span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>But a lot of things like astrology and tarot card reading that we know are bunk now sounded really good in the past. Just because something&#xA0;<em>sounds like</em> it works doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that it does work.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>It&#x2019;s not so easy to sift the signal from the noise.</span></span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true"><span class>But all Tom Brady&#x2019;s friends are doing it!</span></h2>

<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>&#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; you might say, &#x201C;some of that stuff may be useless. But, if everyone successful is doing something, then you can be more confident that it works.&#x201D;</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>But is this true? If all people who get into Harvard read the same books, does it mean reading those books will help you get into Harvard? And if all NFL athletes train in a certain way, does that mean training like them will get you into the NFL?</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>I don&#x2019;t think so.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">The argument from &#x2018;everybody is doing it&#x2019; is something we talked about on my <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="http://thepolymathproject.com/mark-rippetoe">podcast with the strength coach and legend Mark Rippetoe</a></span><span class>. During our talk, Mark gave two counter-examples to the &#x2018;everybody is doing it&#x2019; argument.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class><strong>First, functional Training.</strong></span><span class> Elite NFL teams spend millions of dollars to put their athletes through functional training, which involves fancy movements and tools that look something like this :</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class="md-image md-img-loaded" contenteditable="false" data-src="https://media.defense.gov/2013/Apr/04/2000061577/780/780/0/130302-F-HX320-001.JPG"><img src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/media.defense.gov/2013/Apr/04/2000061577/780/780/0/130302-F-HX320-001.JPG?ssl=1" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.defense.gov/2013/Apr/04/2000061577/780/780/0/130302-F-HX320-001.JPG?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>The </span><span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://startingstrength.com/article/functional-training-an-update">full article</a></span> by Mark is great, but here&#x2019;s an excerpt:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>The primary problem with &#x201C;Functional Training&#x201D; is that it attempts to improve physical characteristics which are unresponsive to submaximal stimulation, like 5-pound dumbbells and medicine ball cleans. <span class><strong>The explosive ability of high-level athletes is a neuromuscular characteristic that is part of their genetic endowment. It&#x2019;s like red hair &#x2013; you either have it or you don&#x2019;t</strong></span>, and all the dye in the world cannot change this fact, even though you may fool the people at Walmart.</em></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Functional Training&#x201D; confuses the <span class>display</span> of athletic ability with its development.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">In other words, the problem with functional training is that <span class><em>it tries to train things that can&#x2019;t be changed</em></span>. </span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>As Mark pointed out in the podcast, no amount of training is going to take your vertical jump from 18 inches to 36 inches. That stuff is genetic, and&#x2014;unless you find a way to make up for this severe deficit in other ways&#x2014;you&#x2019;re not getting into the NFL.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>So there are all these elite teams out there spending millions of dollars on stuff that doesn&#x2019;t work. Oops.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class><strong>The second example is floor pulls.</strong></span><span class> Many elite Olympic weightlifters pull the bar from the floor in demonstrably inefficient ways. At weekend seminars, Mark and his team are often able to add several inches to the bar height of already elite lifters! </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class="md-image md-img-loaded" contenteditable="false" data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-S0611-0025%2C_G%C3%BCnter_Ambra%C3%9F.jpg"><img src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-S0611-0025%2C_G%C3%BCnter_Ambra%C3%9F.jpg?ssl=1" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-S0611-0025%2C_G%C3%BCnter_Ambra%C3%9F.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">So, when studying&#xA0; the best in the world, it&#x2019;s important to ask, &#x201C;Are elite lifters succeeding <span class><em>because</em></span> of what they do or <span class><em>despite</em></span> what they do?&#x201D; It&#x2019;s not always clear, and it&#x2019;s not good to accept what they do as the ultimate truth.</span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Another question to ask is &#x201C;Is this person&#x2019;s success due to luck or skill?&#x201D;. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Even mediocre poker players and investors can &#x201C;win&#x201D; because of luck. And if you&#x2019;ve got good genetics&#x2014;another form of luck&#x2014;you can get away with a lot of stuff ordinary folks cannot.</span></span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true"><span class>Humans are not Model Ts</span></h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Another lesson from the above is that&#x2014;big surprise!&#x2014;people are different.</span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Humans are <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://amzn.to/2P3fWjV">not blank slates</a></span><span class>. We have different personalities, different strengths and weaknesses. You can&#x2019;t run the same &#x2018;success formula&#x2019; through each of us like you can run an algorithm through a computer. Sadly, most of the world still seems to think you can.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Tom Brady&#x2019;s training program isn&#x2019;t going to work for me. Why? Because I&#x2019;m not Tom Brady. I don&#x2019;t have his reaction speed, his proprioceptive awareness, or his ability to recover from training. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Most of us are&#x2014;by definition&#x2014;closer to the average, and what works for the exceptional doesn&#x2019;t always work for the ordinary. If everyone at your local YMCA had to train like a Navy SEAL, most of them would be in the hospital before dinnertime.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>This one-size-fits-all, do-what-others-do kind of thinking is naive, but it seems to be everywhere, even in the scientific literature.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Take education, for example. </span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">In school, I was able to get A&#x2019;s without studying. Yet, I looked down on other kids and blamed them for their bad grades, saying, &#x201C;They get bad grades because they aren&#x2019;t working hard enough.&#x201D; </span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>In retrospect, that was both dishonest and egoistical of me. I didn&#x2019;t work hard at all: Most of my time in school was spent playing video games. My grades were due to talent, and I don&#x2019;t deserve praise for that.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Another example is parenting advice. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker has been pointing out for over a decade now that much of parenting advice is BS (or at least severely misguided). </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Like people selling functional training, people selling parenting advice regularly mistake luck (genetics) for skill (parenting). </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Here&#x2019;s Pinker in </span><span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/steven_pinker-a-biological-understanding-of-human-nature">an interview for Edge</a></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>Hundreds of studies have measured correlations between the practices of parents and the way their children turn out. For example, parents who talk a lot to their children have kids with better language skills, parents who spank have children who grow up to be violent, parents who are neither too authoritarian or too lenient have children who are well-adjusted, and so on. <span class><strong>Most of the parenting expert industry and a lot of government policy turn these correlations into advice to parents, and blame the parents when children don&#x2019;t turn out as they would have liked.</strong></span><span class> [Charles: This is just like how I blamed my peers for not working hard enough!] But correlation does not imply causation. </span></em></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>Parents provide their children with genes as well as an environment, so the fact that talkative parents have kids with good language skills could simply mean that and that the same genes that make parents talkative make children articulate. <span class><strong>Until those studies are replicated with adopted children, who don&#x2019;t get their genes from the people who bring them up, we don&#x2019;t know whether the correlations reflect the effects of parenting, the effects of shared genes, or some mixture.</strong></span><span class> But in most cases even the possibility that the correlations reflect shared genes is taboo. In developmental psychology it&#x2019;s considered impolite even to mention it, let alone test it. </span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>If you want to be a better parent, it&#x2019;s not enough study the parents with the &#x2018;best&#x2019; children and copy their parenting methods. Why? Because a big part of how those kids turned out </span><span class><em>has nothing to do with parenting</em></span><span class>. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>If you want to do a good job of parenting or educating or athletic training, you have to separate what actually works from what </span><span class><em>looks like it works</em></span><span class>. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Likewise, you shouldn&#x2019;t look at the kids who get into Harvard or Princeton and apply their study methods. Why? For the same reasons: A big part of getting into top-tier schools is SAT scores. SAT scores are a glorified IQ test, and much of IQ is genetic.</span></span></p>
<p>A good education program should make everybody better, not simply help the kids who are already good at taking tests succeed.</p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">So what&#x2019;s my point?</h2>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Okay, there were enough taboo topics in this essay to offend 90% of my readership, so it&#x2019;s a miracle if you&#x2019;re still here reading. Thanks.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>To recap, here are the problems with the &#x201C;greatest in the world fallacy&#x201D;:</span></span></p>
<ul class="ul-list" data-mark="*">
<li class="md-list-item">
<p contenteditable="true"><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class><strong>It fails to separate correlation from causation.</strong></span> Warren Buffett (I hope) brushes his teeth each morning. That doesn&#x2019;t mean tooth-brushing is going to make you into a world class investor. Zuckerberg wears the same t-shirt everyday, but would he really be a worse CEO if he didn&#x2019;t? </span></p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p contenteditable="true"><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class><strong>What works for genetic freaks may not work for you.</strong></span> The best in the world aren&#x2019;t the best solely because of what they do. They&#x2019;re also the best because of what they <span class><em>are</em></span> (genetics). Just because Navy SEALs can train 8 days a week and slap away shotgun blasts doesn&#x2019;t mean you can too. Ask, &#x201C;Are they the best because of what they do or <span class><em>despite</em></span> what they do?&#x201D;</span></p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class contenteditable="true"><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class><strong>Just because the best do something doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s the best way of doing it.</strong></span><span class> If all we did was emulate the best, we&#x2019;d still be battling mammoths with sharp wooden sticks. History is young, and there&#x2019;s a lot of room to think, criticize, reflect and improve.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>If you think about it, &#x201C;do what the best do&#x201D; is another form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority">argument from authority</a>. If we always took the &#x201C;greatest in the world&#x201D; for granted, we&#x2019;d still be living in caves, gnawing on roots and tubers. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>And we&#x2019;d still be high-jumping like this:</span></span></p>

<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>I used to think you could study the best and emulate them to get their results. I am no longer so naive. We can learn from these people, but it&#x2019;s an error to blindly worship what they do.</span></span></p>
<p>Instead of worshipping our heroes, let&#x2019;s submit their ideas to the best criticism we can muster. Only then can we separate signal from noise, correlation from causation, and what works from what doesn&#x2019;t.</p>
