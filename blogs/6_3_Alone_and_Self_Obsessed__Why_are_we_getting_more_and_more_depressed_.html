					<p>One of the better books I&#x2019;ve read recently is Gerd Gigerenzer&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em><a href="https://amzn.to/2rEzMqQ">Risk Savvy</a></em>.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s a German researcher who has done high-profile work in decision-making and rationality. The goal of his book is to help ordinary folks make better choices in the real world.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll write more about the meat of the book another time. Today, I want to look at one interesting trend the book mentions:&#xA0;<strong>young Americans seem to be getting more and more depressed</strong>.</p>
