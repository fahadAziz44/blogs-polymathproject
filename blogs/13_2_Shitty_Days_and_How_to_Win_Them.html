					<p>Today was a shitty day.</p>
<p>I spent half my afternoon staring at a computer screen. The other half of the afternoon was spent feeling sorry about the first half.</p>
<p>The result? A grand total of 0 words written.</p>
<p>It didn&#x2019;t stop there, of course. To celebrate my grand failure, I drank a latte, ate half a pound of sweet potato, and spent the evening vegetating in a&#xA0;food coma.</p>
<p>Shit happens.</p>
<p>I have a reputation for being in control. It&#x2019;s not true. In the past, a day like this would trigger a downward spiral of binge eating and self-hate. One bad decision would turn into two, which would turn into four&#x2026;and on and on. It would take me months to get out.</p>
<p>That doesn&#x2019;t happen anymore. Nowadays, I can be back at cruising velocity in a few days.</p>
<p>Beating shitty days comes down to two things, really:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental toughness (a learnable skill)</li>
<li>Specific techniques (a learnable skill)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x2019;m still feeling shitty right now. I didn&#x2019;t want to write this. I wanted to stay at home and feel sorry for myself.</p>
<p>But I know how to get myself out.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s how.</p>
<h2>1. Recognize it&#x2019;s a shitty day</h2>
<p>Don&#x2019;t laugh. This is important.</p>
<p>The worst mistake I&#x2019;ve made in the past is holding shitty days to the standard of ordinary. These types of days are a different beast. They deserve special treatment.</p>
<p>If you want something lame but surprisingly effective, try saying, &#x201C;Today is a shitty day&#x201D; out loud. I did this about 15 times a few minutes ago. I feel a lot better.</p>
<p>Whatever works, right?</p>
<p>Put down your ego. If it&#x2019;s a shitty day, accept it. That&#x2019;s the first step.</p>
<h2>2. Reach out for help</h2>
<p>Before, whenever I had a shitty day, I would try to do things on my own. Nowadays, the first thing I do is message one or two good friends to ask for help.</p>
<p>Again, put down your ego here. You&#x2019;re compromised&#x2014;you had a bad day because you are NOT in control. This is the ideal time to ask for help.</p>
<p>Plus, It&#x2019;s not a burden to friends, <em>it&#x2019;s a favor</em>. If a good friend is having a hard time, I would be insulted if they didn&#x2019;t ask me for help.</p>
<p>Today, so I sent a message to two good friends.</p>
<p>Message to Female Friend (we met earlier this morning):</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Sorry to be awkward today, I&#x2019;m not doing too well, actually.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Message to Male Friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I just spent all afternoon watching stupid videos, and now I&#x2019;m depressed, haha.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing fancy, but it doesn&#x2019;t need to be. Just let them know you&#x2019;re struggling. Here were their responses&#x2026;</p>
<p>Female Friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If it&#x2019;s about writing, just sit down and write like you always do!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Male Friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  That occasional binge does a lot of mental harm, but in all reality the damage is minimal. [&#x2026;] It&#x2019;s normal to slide back and forth, as long as the moving average is up.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The answers you&#x2019;ll get might be &#x201C;obvious&#x201D; things that you know already. But that&#x2019;s not the point. The point is to realize you aren&#x2019;t alone&#x2026; Again, this is under appreciated.</p>
<h2>2. Drastically lower standards</h2>
<p>Shitty days come from not feeling in control.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say you ate eleven chocolate croissants in the morning. Your diet is ruined. Life sucks. What&#x2019;s the point of going to the gym anymore? Now you just want to curl into a ball and eat eleven more croissants&#x2026;</p>
<p>With this kind of negative momentum, <strong>doing anything positive is a huge win.</strong></p>
<p>Do you normally deadlift 400 pounds for 5 reps? Drastically lower standards. Just do 1 rep instead.</p>
<p>Do you normally write 2000 words a day? Drastically lower standards. Write 200 words instead. Is that too hard? No problem. Just write 20.</p>
<p><em>Do anything you can to make the first step happen.</em></p>
<p>I didn&#x2019;t want to write today. I wanted to eat a giant plate of mango sticky rice and then stare at my bedroom ceiling all night.</p>
<p>Yet, here I am. Here&#x2019;s what saved me: I said to myself, &#x201C;Just write 500 shitty words. Your readers will forgive you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That was it. I messaged my friends and drastically lowered my standards. I sat down, took out my laptop, and started typing.</p>
<p>Now that I&#x2019;m writing, it doesn&#x2019;t seem so hard anymore. I&#x2019;m well past the 500-word mark, and I could write a few thousand more.</p>
<h1>3. Ride the momentum</h1>
<p>Savvy readers might have noticed that all of the above steps have a single goal in mind&#x2014;momentum.</p>
<p>Yes, one bad decision can cascade into two and four and eight and on and on. But so can good decisions.</p>
<p><em>Do whatever it takes&#xA0;to get the ball rolling.</em> The rest is easy.</p>
<p>Less than an hour ago, I said to myself, &#x201C;Just 500 shitty words.&#x201D; Now I&#x2019;m all finished, and I think I&#x2019;ll go to the gym too.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t such a shitty day after all.</p>
