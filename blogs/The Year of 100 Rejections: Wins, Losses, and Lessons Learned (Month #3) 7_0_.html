<hr>
<p>Here&#x2019;s how this month went:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I finished&#xA0;2 short stories.&#xA0;</strong>This was the same number of stories as last month.</li>
<li><strong>I made 5 submissions.</strong>&#xA0;Last month, I only made 3 submissions.</li>
<li><strong>I received 4 rejections</strong>. Last month, I received 3 rejections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total so far:&#xA0;<strong>10/100 Rejections</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;ve been following along, you&#x2019;ve probably realized two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I&#x2019;m behind schedule.&#xA0;</strong>I wanted to have 15-20 rejections by now, but I&#x2019;m only at 10.</li>
<li><strong>There isn&#x2019;t any data this month</strong>. I provided detailed graphs for months 1-2, but there aren&#x2019;t any for month 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I figured this would happen sooner or later.</p>
<p>Put simply, what happened this month was that I &#x201C;fell off the wagon.&#x201D; This happens all the time when setting long-term goals&#x2014;we break our rules (eating a cheat meal) or lose motivation, and everything falls apart.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what I think knocked me off the wagon:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time constraints made me break my habits.</strong>&#xA0;For months one and two, I had a good habit of daily writing going (averaging 500-600 words a day). Last month, this habit broke because I launched a small business that ended up sucking up a lot of my time. I fell off the wagon and never got back on.</li>
<li><strong>Falling motivation</strong>. Along with this break in habits, I felt less motivated to write stories in March. I think this happened for two main reasons: (1) there isn&#x2019;t much of a writing community around me, (2) I&#x2019;m not getting enough clear feedback to help me learn.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plans for Month #4</h2>
<p>With the above in mind, what should be my goal for Month #4?</p>
<p>My number one priority, I think, should be to&#xA0;<em>get back on the wagon</em>. In other words, for April, I want to get back in the habit of writing every day.</p>
<p>Learning, finishing stories, etc. is important, but none of that will happen unless I get in the habit of writing again.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;ll try to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go back to basics</strong>. When habit systems fail, it&#x2019;s important to reset at a lower level. If I try to do all the work I was doing before, I&#x2019;ll burn out and fall off the wagon again.</li>
<li><strong>Make daily goals easy</strong>. As part of &#x201C;going back to basics&#x201D;, I want to make my daily goals easy to achieve. Something like &#x201C;Write 100 words after turning on the computer&#x201D; might be a good habit to work towards.</li>
<li><strong>Not worry too much about the big picture.</strong> It can be de-motivational if I realize that I &#x201C;need to get 90 more rejections&#x201D;. This month, I won&#x2019;t worry too much about how many rejections I need to get. Rather, I&#x2019;ll focus on just writing things and trying to enjoy the process.</li>
<li><strong>Get more involved in a&#xA0;</strong><b>community</b>. Thought I told myself I&#x2019;d join some writing groups, I haven&#x2019;t actually gone to any meetings. I think it&#x2019;s about time to do that. I&#x2019;ve signed up for an event next weekend&#x2026; We&#x2019;ll see how that goes.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#x2019;s all for this month. Not that good of a month, but every month can&#x2019;t be perfect &#x1F642;</p>
<p>See you at the end of Month #4!</p>
