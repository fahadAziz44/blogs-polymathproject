					<p>You&#x2019;re writing a letter to the past.</p>
<p>To teenage you.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s your goal: <strong>give advice to maximize</strong><strong>&#xA0;personal growth.</strong></p>
<p>What would you write?</p>
<p>###</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Hey Charles,</p>
<p class="qtext_para">You&#x2019;re unhappy and don&#x2019;t have a girlfriend. Heck, you don&#x2019;t even have friends. Don&#x2019;t worry about that for now. Those things will come. For now, follow these directions&#x2026;</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Do the following <i>in this order</i>:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Learn how to metalearn. </b>Don&#x2019;t study &#x201C;business&#x201D;, study<i> how to learn. </i>You can be decent at anything in 20 hours or less. <i>Master the process first.</i></li>
<li><b>Master</b><b><i> </i></b><b>social skills. </b>Who you spend time with <i>defines</i> who you will become. Read Carnegie&#x2019;s book. Practice. Build real friends and ignore the fake ones. <i>Skip class and go to parties.</i> Be vulnerable. You can&#x2019;t do it all alone.</li>
<li><b>Build a breadwinner. </b>You&#x2019;ve got 2/3 core skills. Now you need funding. Find <i>contract work </i>that pays $50+ an hour<i>. </i>Programming is good. Writing is good. Get to the top 5% and be likeable&#x2014;money won&#x2019;t be an issue. Work for free at first. Then don&#x2019;t. <i>Use this to fund the rest of your life.</i></li>
<li><b>Surround yourself with masters. </b>You&#x2019;ve got money and social skills. Find the top 1% of people that inspire you and <b>follow them everywhere</b>. If they have workshops, go to them. If they run a company, join it. If they&#x2019;re in another country, <i>buy the frickin&#x2019; plane ticket and go see them</i>. Every hour with them is worth thousands.</li>
<li><b>Live life in experiments. </b>Live life in 2-week experiments and 3-month projects. You can&#x2019;t predict the future. People change. You won&#x2019;t know what you like. You&#x2019;ll learn faster and have more fun this way. <i>Never dig your own grave.</i></li>
<li><b>Enjoy. </b>Lastly,<b> </b>don&#x2019;t forget to enjoy the ride. You&#x2019;re developing because it makes your life better. Don&#x2019;t miss the NOW in exchange for LATER. Have a good run, my boy.</li>
</ol>
<p class="qtext_para"><i>Don&#x2019;t settle for average</i>. Think for yourself. Have a wonderful journey.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Love you bro,<br>
Charles</p>
