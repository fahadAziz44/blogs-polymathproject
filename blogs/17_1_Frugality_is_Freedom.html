					<p>Jim and Rob are friends.</p>
<p>They haven&#x2019;t seen each other in years. To catch up, they&#x2019;re chatting over a beer at the local bar.</p>
<p>Both of them have the same job (tech support), live in the same city (Charlottsville), and grew up eating the same boxed lunches at the same suburban high school.</p>
<p>Rob and Jim start talking about monthly expenses. Jim spends $1500 a month. Rob spends $3000.</p>
<p>Clearly, Rob is twice as happy as Jim.</p>
<p>Wait&#x2026;</p>
<p>Nobody sensible believes that. We don&#x2019;t need Harvard PhDs to tell us that spending $2 doesn&#x2019;t make me twice as happy as $1.</p>
<p>Yet people seem blind to this when it comes to the big picture.</p>
<p>Why are we chasing ever bigger paychecks, ever bigger purchases and ever bigger versions of the same things we don&#x2019;t need?</p>
<p>It doesn&#x2019;t take a whole of of effort to notice that these people aren&#x2019;t happy.</p>
<p>Past a certain point there is no relation between spending and happiness. Choose two people at random. If they&#x2019;re both making a decent salary (say, 40k+), there&#x2019;s no guarantee that the poorer person is less happy.</p>
<p>In fact, there&#x2019;s a good chance the richer guy is the unhappy one.</p>
<h2>The Hedonic Treadmill: Why Spending Doesn&#x2019;t Matter</h2>
<p>If I upgrade from regular, $1 ice cream desserts in the evening to $2 ice cream desserts, it&#x2019;ll make me pretty happy for a day.</p>
<p>But, a few weeks later, I&#x2019;ll get used to the $2 ice cream desserts. Now I need something else.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s the &#x201C;Hedonic Treadmill&#x201D;&#x2014;we get used to what we have and need something even better to get the same fix.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can <em>reverse</em> the treadmill with less damage than we think.</p>
<p>If I cut spending by 40% by say, drinking black coffee instead of lattes every day and choosing a used car over a new luxury one, I might suffer for a few weeks.</p>
<p>But, in the long term, a 40% cut in spending does not cut my quality of life 40%.</p>
<p>Humans adapt.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I sold my car. I was gonna have to walk everywhere. How was I going to buy groceries? What if it rained?</p>
<p>Now I love walking. I save a bunch of money on transportation. I&#x2019;m healthier And a lot of my best ideas come while walking.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ok&#x201D;, you say, &#x201C;I get the part about adaptation. But where does freedom come in?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m glad that you asked.</p>
<h2>Why Frugality is Freedom</h2>
<p>Again: a 50% drop in spending does not equal a 50% drop in satisfaction.</p>
<p>But that 50% drop does equal something else:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twice as much free time (because you are half as much), OR</li>
<li>A huge increase in discretionary income (from saving 50%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Frugality is a &#x201C;philosopher&#x2019;s stone&#x201D;. We can cut spending by upwards of 50% to free up huge amounts of resources in the form of money and time.</p>
<p>You can then take this money and time and reinvest it in things that really matter.</p>
<p>The average American works 2000 hours a year. Cut work hours by 50%, and that&#x2019;s another 1000 hours of freedom.</p>
<p>Where will <em>you</em> spend it all?</p>
