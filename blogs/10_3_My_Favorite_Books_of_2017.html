					<p>I read a lot of books this year.</p>
<p>To celebrate the end of the year, here are 17 of my favorites from 2017.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Two rules for this list:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">The list contains only non-fiction books.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">The books are organized (roughly) by general interest&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the most esoteric books are at the bottom.</li>
</ol>

<p>Gould is my kind of writer. Brilliant, curious, bold and terrifyingly well-read. This volume takes the some of Gould&#x2019;s best work from 10 years of monthly essays (published in 10 volumes) that Gould wrote for the Natural History magazine.</p>

<p>The most comprehensive yet practical book on building &amp; changing habits I&#x2019;ve read to date. Dean dissolves some of the silly myths (21 days, really?) about habit-building and replaces them with carefully researched, practical insights.</p>

<p>Sutherland is the Executive Creative Director of Ogilvy Advertising. He&#x2019;s also hilarious. And brilliant. The interviews and essays here are a entertaining blend of wit and insights behavioral economics. I finished the whole thing in an afternoon.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve long suspected that peoples&#x2019; money problems are often not about money itself but our&#xA0;<em>perception.&#xA0;</em>John Armstrong gives a practical, but philosophical, take on disentangling money&#xA0;<em>problems</em> from money&#xA0;<em>worries</em>.</p>

<p>A father-son conversation between Revel, who was one of France&#x2019;s leading philosophers and intellectuals and Ricard, an elite molecular geneticist who quit his job to become a Tibetan Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>The only way to understand, really, how people in the West think is to try and understand people different from us see the world. I learned a lot from this book.</p>

<p>This removed most of what little remaining desire I had to become rich. A great introduction to the dark side of affluence, globalization, and unending connectivity.</p>

<p>I wrote all over this one. Watts, a sociologist, gets at of my favorite themes: why common sense fails in complex systems, why we fail to predict history, why smart people with good intentions end up doing terrible things, and much more.</p>

<p>Complex goals -happiness, business success, love, etc. -are often best achieved indirectly. Kay gets at what I see as a flaw in a lot of &#x201C;self-help&#x201D; advice (and policy advice) out there: in their obsession with promising easy answers, these people guarantee that they will help little with the complex problems that&#xA0;<em>real</em> life in the&#xA0;<em>real</em> world entails.</p>

<p>Thinking never happens alone. Clear thinking means going outside of your own mind and also examining the cultures, groups, institutions and belief systems that, whether you know it or not, shape your thinking in myriad and invisible ways.</p>
<p>I scribbled notes all over this one. Then, when digging through the references, I got enough new reading material to last me through all of next year.</p>

<p>Zeldin is optimistic but not naive. He takes the reader on an eye-opening tour of how we humans live, have lived, and dream of living.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve long been puzzled by the&#xA0;<em>confidence&#xA0;</em>people both on the Left and the Right have in their beliefs about the world. If both sides have smart, lucid and passionate thinkers, how is it that they equally believe that the other side is wrong?</p>
<p>This is a life-changing exploration of how evolutionary biology and human nature shape belief, action, meaning and morality.</p>

<p>A collection of the essays from Simon Leys (the pen name of the sinologist Pierre Ryckmans). Leys was a polymath, and it shows in his writing. Essays range from literary commentary on Don Quixote to the culture and art of China to the love of reading itself. So good that I read it twice this year: and it was better the second time.</p>

<p>Intelligence and good intentions do not always mean you go on to do good things. Scott&#x2019;s book is a grand survey of how people with big plans and mission to &#x201C;change the world&#x201D; often end up changing the world in very different, and ugly ways, from what they intended.</p>

<p>John Gray -the philosopher, not the self-help author -is the author I&#x2019;ve spent the most time reading this year. His work takes some background in political philosophy to understand, but his work changed my understanding of how myth and belief continue to shape our lives. [A good place to start with Gray&#x2019;s work is his&#xA0;<em><a href="http://amzn.to/2zksVob">The Silence of Animals</a>, </em>which is meant for a general audience<em>.</em>]
</p><p>A few more I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edward Slingerland, <a href="http://amzn.to/2BUkD9g">Trying Not to Try</a></li>
<li>Daniel Levitin, <a href="http://amzn.to/2D0ZHwI">The Organized Mind</a></li>
<li>Umberto Eco, <a href="http://amzn.to/2BCUxeh">How to Write a Thesis</a></li>
<li>Steven Pinker, <a href="http://amzn.to/2BTWm3u">The Blank Slate</a></li>
<li>Liddell Hart, <a href="http://amzn.to/2BTOLSi">Why Don&#x2019;t We Learn from History?</a></li>
<li>Stephen Koch, <a href="http://amzn.to/2BpQTjM">The Modern Library Writer&#x2019;s Workshop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Turn off your phone and computer and always carry a couple books with you. You&#x2019;ll be surprised by how much you can read in a year.</p>
