<div>Total Focus Time: 4.62 hours per day</div>
<div>Work Time: 4.07 hours per day</div>
<div>Training Time: 0.55 hours per day</div>
<div></div>
<div>Work focus stayed essentially the same, but we got some more training in this week. It kind of looks like we stalled, but hours per week aren&#x2019;t the whole story.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But let&#x2019;s look at some context.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3>Context</h3>
<div>This week was another hectic travel week: three different airports, hours on run-down Chinese buses, poor internet connectivity (damn the Great Firewall), reunions with relatives, etc. If anything, the theme for this week was to &#x201C;Hold the line!&#x201D;</div>
<div></div>
<div>I knew prior to this week that it would be nigh impossible to both keep up training and maintain a regular work schedule. Hell, this country doesn&#x2019;t even have coffee. I went into it with the goal of &#x201C;Hold the line!&#x201D; instead. The goal this week was to try to improve, but be satisfied with status quo.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, in that regard, I deserve a pat on the back.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>What went well this week?</h2>
<div></div>
<h4><b>Virtues Checklist</b></h4>
<div>The biggest spreadsheet change from last week was the &#x201C;Virtues Checklist&#x201D;. The idea, in brief, was to sculpt personal change by reinforcing certain types of behavior. More on this in another post, but the basics were:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Smile</b>&#xA0;&#x2013; Go out of your way to make somebody (a friend, a stranger, anybody) smile once a day.</li>
<li><b>Spiritual </b>&#x2013; Spend a block of time every day *not* doing things for personal gain. This means no time tracking, no &#x201C;studying&#x201D;, no income generation. Read a good fiction book, go see some friends, look into the sky and enjoy the clouds, etc.</li>
<li><b>Fortitude</b>&#xA0;&#x2013; Build mental toughness by designing a willpower goal for yourself based on the day&#x2019;s circumstances. Hungry? Let operating without hunger be your goal. Raining? Get wet and laugh at it. Bored? Deal with it.</li>
</ul>
<div>These were a fantastic change&#x2013;the best I&#x2019;ve made yet! Because I wanted a little green checkbox in my spreadsheet (silly, I know), I found myself going out of my way to make someone smile or reframing a perceived negative event into a positive one.&#xA0;</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>These are basic principles that we <i>know</i>&#xA0;make people satisfied, happier and more capable in a variety of situations, but my biggest problem has always been converting knowledge into action. This virtues checklist gives me a way to take knowledge, program it into an achievable set of week goals, and execute to reinforce that behavior.</div>
<div></div>
<h4>Garbage Time</h4>
<div>I hit a turning point this week. For years and years, my go-to activity when mentally fatigue was some sort of video entertainment. It used to be anime and Japanese TV shows. Recently, it was online streaming of poker and online games.</div>
<div></div>
<div>No matter how much I &#x201C;willed&#x201D; it, the change wasn&#x2019;t happening. I would try to resist, give in, feel guilty, and do it all over again.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Somehow, being present, tracking my wasted time, and adding to my awareness of the little &#x201C;triggers&#x201D; throughout the day that would send me down the path of no return has helped. The amount of wasted garbage time has drastically fallen.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And this is a win-win scenario too. I waste less time. This means my brain is less clouded. I have more time to focus on other types of activities as well. My sleep quality increases. This was always the biggest monster for me, and now I can see the light at the end.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#x2014;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Basically, this was a week filled with many small victories. And all the green on the spreadsheet supports that. I&#x2019;ve come to see the spreadsheet tracking as a form of meditation&#x2013;it requires awareness of your day to day action and provides direct feedback on the choices you make in a day.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>What&#x2019;s changing for next week?</h2>
<div>The only qualm I had with this week&#x2019;s spreadsheet was how high adherence was. When I start succeeding too much, I start to worry that I&#x2019;m not setting the bar high enough.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Still, this particular setup worked quite well this week, and I&#x2019;d like to give it another week of testing under more &#x201C;stable&#x201D; scenarios (Thailand next week!). Get some more information about where the leaks are.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#x2019;m did some basic pruning (moving training to another spreadsheet), and that&#x2019;s it!</div>
