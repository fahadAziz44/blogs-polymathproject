<p>Here&#x2019;s a simple tip to add 10 years to your life.</p>
<p>Stop wasting time.</p>
<p>Wasted time seems harmless, but those hours spent watching silly videos, checking email, and upvoting pictures of babies add up. A lot.</p>
<p>I realized this while trying to answer the question: <em>&#x201C;How much time am I actually wasting?&#x201D;</em> I logged all my daily activities for a week and looked back at what I actually did. <strong>I was wasting an average of 4 hours a day.</strong></p>
<p>Now, my standards for <em>wasted</em> may be different from the norm, so let&#x2019;s look at our average, fictional friend Joe.</p>
<p>Joe is your average, mild-mannered American. He graduated from a pretty good school and earns a pretty good salary. He&#x2019;s 30 now, and has wonderful friends. Joe tells his friends over Facebook how he loves France and wants to learn the language. However, Joe is &#x201C;too busy&#x201D; with &#x201C;work&#x201D; and &#x201C;life&#x201D;. His friends upvote in sympathy. After all, they are &#x201C;too busy&#x201D; too.</p>
<p>Joe, just like his friends, spends 3 hours a day on social media. What does that look like over a lifetime?</p>

<h3 id="do-the-math">Do the Math</h3>
<p>Joe wastes 3 hours a day:</p>
<pre><code>3 hours * 365 days in a year = 1095 hours wasted per year
</code></pre>
<p>He&#x2019;s confident he&#x2019;ll live for 50 more years at least:</p>
<pre><code>1095  hours * 50 years = 54,750 hours wasted in a lifetime
</code></pre>
<p>Joe sleeps 8 hours a night:</p>
<pre><code>54,750 / 16  hours awake per day = 3,422 days wasted
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm, I wonder how many years that is?</p>
<pre><code>3,422 / 365 = 9.4 years wasted
</code></pre>
<p><strong>9.4 years lost to social media</strong></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a lot of years spent on Facebook.</p>
<p>A lifetime too long for you? Here&#x2019;s a look at what Joe (or you) could do with 3 hours a day for just one year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read 250+ books</strong></li>
<li><strong>Earn 6 months of salary</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn to program</strong></li>
<li><strong>Become fluent in French</strong> (or any other language)</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, you could spend that time having adventures, meeting up with friends and treasuring the time with your family.</p>
<p>Wasting time is like killing yourself slowly. It&#x2019;s tens of thousands of hours in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Yet, most of us keep doing it.</p>
<p>Why? Because <strong>we don&#x2019;t realize</strong> and <strong>we&#x2019;re addicted.</strong></p>
<p>Quitting cigarettes can add 10 or more years to your life expectancy. A hundred years ago, nobody realized this. So they kept smoking. It&#x2019;s the same with wasted time. You know you&#x2019;re wasting time, but you don&#x2019;t realize how much until you stop and look at the big picture.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&#x2019;s common knowledge that cigarettes kill. People still smoke. Why? <em>Quitting is hard when you&#x2019;re addicted.</em> Same deal with wasted time, people who waste time have bad habits hard wired into their systems. When I was weaning myself off social media, I found myself reflexively checking email or opening Facebook &#x2013; the tab was open before I realized it.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not saying that you have to quit all social media or to never waste time again. This is just a thought experiment. Got things you want to do but &#x201C;don&#x2019;t have the time?&#x201D; I encourage you to take a step back and <em>look</em>. Track the numbers. Be brutally honest. Do something about it.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-about-it">What to do about it</h3>
<p><strong>1. Define.</strong> The first thing to do is define what wasted time is to you. For me, it was any activity that did not contribute to my short term or long term well being. Make a list of the activities you think are most wasteful.</p>
<p><strong>2. Track.</strong> For a few days, track your time with something like RescueTime (automated) or Toggl (manual). At the end, tally up all the time spent of wasteful activities.</p>
<p><strong>3. Reflect.</strong> Look at the total time you wasted and ask yourself, &#x201C;<em>What could I have been doing instead?</em>&#x201D; Choose to take action or do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fast.</strong> Spend a week where you keep wasted time at 30 minutes or less. At the end, take time to pause and reflect again. Did the experience make your life more or less fulfilling? More or less enjoyable?</p>
<p>Chances are your friends &amp; family will still love you and you&#x2019;ll have found the time to something new, exciting, and <em>valuable</em>.</p>
<p>Enjoy your 10 years, I&#x2019;m enjoying mine.</p>
