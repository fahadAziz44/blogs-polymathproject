					<p>If your writing skills aren&#x2019;t improving, you&#x2019;re probably an advice hoarder.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m no Tolstoy, but I know bad habits when I see them. Advice hoarders collect page after page of information on how to improve their writing skills, but they&#xA0;never find the time to convert that knowledge into action.</p>
<p>Some signs you are an advice hoarder:</p>
<ul>
<li>You own more pages about &#x201C;how to write&#x201D; than you&#x2019;ve written in your entire life.</li>
<li>You collect pages and pages of quotes from master writers but don&#x2019;t do anything with them.</li>
<li>Your writing hasn&#x2019;t seen visible improvement in years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good writing requires <em>action</em>.</p>
<p>You don&#x2019;t have a knowledge problem. Knowledge is everywhere.</p>
<p>You have an action problem.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s how to convert writing knowledge into writing action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a piece of writing advice</li>
<li>Convert it into an exercise</li>
<li>Do it</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#x2019;s not rocket science. But doing this will put you ahead of 90% of writers.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s look at an example.</p>
<p>A quote from Thomas Jefferson&#x2014;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>&#x201C;The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.&#x201D;</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#x2019;s good advice.</p>
<p>Now let&#x2019;s make it into an exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a sub-par piece of writing</li>
<li>Cut 20% of the words</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, not rocket science.</p>
<p>But the ability to identify a weak point (wordiness, in this case) and then actively improve it is a skill most writers don&#x2019;t have.</p>
<p>Master it, and you crush the competition.</p>
<h2>1. Find Subpar Writing</h2>
<p>An excellent source of suppar writing is the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/">/r/WritingPrompts</a>. On it, users post prompts and amateur writers share their writing.</p>
<p>Here is one of the prompts:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A friendship between a time traveler and an immortal. Wherever the time traveler ends up, the immortal is there to catch him up to speed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The worst submissions tend to be at the bottom.</p>
<p>I chose a passage from one of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5c990o/wp_a_friendship_between_a_time_traveler_and_an/d9v53s9/">the submissions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Leonardo always wanted to visit New York City at the turn of the century. It was something he had been dreaming of doing ever since he had first invented Time Travel. As, he realized, he had come from a time where America was long gone and the relics of the past outweighed the creations of the future. But the turn of the millennia, with the world on edge; he had to see that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, let&#x2019;s get editing.</p>
<h2>2. Cut 20% of the Words</h2>
<p>The passage has 73 words. Let&#x2019;s cut it by 20%&#x2026;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ever since he invented Time Travel, Leonardo had dreamed of a visit to New York City. In his time, America was long gone, and relics of the past outweighed creations of the future. But the turn of the millennia, with the world on edge; he had to see that.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks better, no?</p>
<p>This kind active practice has done wonders for my own writing.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s something I wrote almost two years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The surroundings we can control affect our mental state. When you&#x2019;re mentally afflicted, the surroundings get worse. The reverse also happens &#x2013; sloth in daily life has an impact on your mental state. This is a powerful argument for keeping everything clean and tidy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Makes your eyes glaze over, doesn&#x2019;t it?</p>
<p>Find your weakness. Attack it. Grow. Repeat.</p>
<p>Happy writing.</p>
