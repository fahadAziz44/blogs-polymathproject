					<p>If there&#x2019;s one word to describe Isaac Asimov, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;prolific&#x201D;.</p>
<p>To match the number of novels, letters, essays and other scribblings that Isaac produced in his lifetime, you would need to write at the pace of one full-length novel every two weeks for <em>25 years.</em></p>
<p>For Isaac Asimov, writer&#x2019;s block was simply not an option.</p>
<p>As a semi-regular writer, I often find myself stuck frozen-fingered in front of an empty page. Looking for wisdom on the matter, I turned to Asimov&#x2019;s autobiography, <a href="http://amzn.to/2hixgk0"><em>It&#x2019;s Been a Good Life</em></a>.</p>
<p>I wasn&#x2019;t disappointed with what I found.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s take a look&#x2026;</p>
<h2>1. Accept That Writing is Hard</h2>
<p>A struggling writer once asked Isaac Asimov, &#x201C;Where do you get your ideas?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Isaac responded&#x2014;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#x201C;By thinking and thinking and thinking till I&#x2019;m ready to kill myself. [&#x2026;] Did you ever think it was easy to get a good idea?&#x201D;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Aha. It&#x2019;s not just flashes of insight on demand, not even for the great Isaac Asimov. Like every other writer,&#xA0;he struggled to have good ideas.</p>
<p>And the struggle was worth every moment&#x2014;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I couldn&#x2019;t sleep last night so I lay awake thinking of an article to write and I&#x2019;d think and think and cry at the sad parts. I had a wonderful night.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, nobody said conquering writer&#x2019;s block was going to be easy.</p>
<h2>2. Recognize You Are Stuck</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the words just won&#x2019;t come out. It happens to everyone&#x2014;even Isaac Asimov:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Frequently, when I am at work on a science-fiction novel, I find myself heartily sick of it and unable to write another word.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We all get stuck. That&#x2019;s not something you can control.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s what happens next, your <em>reaction</em>, that makes all the difference.</p>
<p>What does Asimov do?</p>
<h2>3. Let Your Mind Fill Up Again</h2>
<blockquote><p>
  I don&#x2019;t stare at blank sheets of paper. I don&#x2019;t spend days and nights cudgeling a head that is empty of ideas. Instead, I simply leave the novel and go on to any of the dozen other projects that are on tap. I write an editorial, or an essay, or a short story, or work on one of my nonfiction books. <strong>By the time I&#x2019;ve grown tired of these things, my mind has been able to do its proper work and fill up again.</strong> I return to my novel and find myself able to write easily once more.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#x2019;s so powerful&#x2026;</p>
<p>Here it is again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put down whatever you are working on</li>
<li>Go work on other projects (until they make you sick)</li>
<li>Return to find your mind filled with ideas again</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#x2019;t fight the block. Give it space to breathe. Come back to it later, and you may find that it is no longer there.</p>
<h2>4. The Secret Sauce</h2>
<p>There&#x2019;s something more behind all the techniques. This is the real reason Isaac was able to&#xA0;show up day after day and write over 200 books in his lifetime&#x2014;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What I decided was that I wasn&#x2019;t writing ten times as many books in order to get ten times the monetary returns, but in order to have ten times the pleasure.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#x2019;t be in it for the money, do it for love.</p>
