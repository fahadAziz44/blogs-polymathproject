					<p>I hadn&#x2019;t showered in weeks.</p>
<p>I sat on the floor. Or, what remained of the floor. Most of it was buried in old McDonald&#x2019;s nugget packaging and unfinished homework. My room smelled of mold. Hell, I smelled of mold.</p>
<p>But I noticed none of that.</p>
<p>My eyes were on the screen, as they had been for the last 16 hours. I was playing League of Legends&#x2014;an online game where teams of animated characters fight to destroy the enemy&#x2019;s base. My character was a girl. She was cute and played music on a keyboard. Maybe I&#x2019;d marry someone like her.</p>
<p>I was an addict. Each day, I would wake at noon, skip class and play until I couldn&#x2019;t keep my eyes open. I survived on McNuggets and six-dollar burritos from the joint next door.</p>
<p>I had no future. I was a loser. But I couldn&#x2019;t stop. It was too much &#x2018;fun&#x2019;&#x2026;</p>
<p>That was college. Somehow, I managed to graduate. My test-taking skills saved me. I got a job. Somebody hired me.</p>
<p>That changed nothing.</p>
<h1>Life Pulled the Plug</h1>
<p>In a different life, maybe nothing would have changed. I would have kept my head in the sand.</p>
<p>But life pulled the plug on me.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know what the trigger was. Maybe it was my induction into &#x201C;adulthood&#x201D;. Maybe it was the loneliness. Maybe it was looking into the eyes of people at work&#x2026;and seeing nothing.</p>
<p>It was a mid-life crisis. I was 21.</p>
<p>Yea, sure, I was pampered and privileged and my parents paid for my education&#x2026; but it didn&#x2019;t feel like that.</p>
<p>The fear seized me. It wasn&#x2019;t the in-your-face kind of fear you get when you see a snake in your driveway. It was softer, deeper and always there. It was the &#x201C;trapped in outer space and running out of oxygen&#x201D; kind of fear.</p>
<p>I was suffocating. There was nobody to talk too. I had no friends. My parents wouldn&#x2019;t understand.</p>
<h1>Anything but that.</h1>
<p>I&#x2019;d been hiding the doubt on a corner shelf for the past two decades and now the shelf was broken and all of it fell down and hit me on the head.</p>
<p>It was a strange terror of not meaning, not doing, not living&#x2026; Anything was better than that.</p>
<p>So I tried.</p>
<p>I looked at myself. Maybe for the first time. I reached out for help. I started reading. I&#x2019;d never had role models before. This time, I found them in books. I went to the gym. I stopped eating nuggets (but not burritos). I talked to strangers. Girls, even. I got rejected. It sucked.</p>
<p>But I kept trying.</p>
<p>I had relapses. I would fall back into a&#xA0;mess of self-hate. I binged on onion rings, called in sick to stay home and play card games, and dodged reality with poorly subtitled Korean soap operas.</p>
<p>But then, sure as sugar, the empty fear returned. <em>Oh my god, it&#x2019;s happening again.</em> And there was nothing worse than <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>So, no matter the suck, I got out and started over.</p>
<p>Each time, I failed. Each time, things got a bit better. I could control my desires. I learned new skills. I found a little confidence.</p>
<p>Something interesting started to happen.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, girls started to notice. Friends came to ask for advice. I got compliments on my dress, my intellect, my way of life&#x2026; People started to use escape words: I was now &#x201C;gifted&#x201D;, &#x201C;talented&#x201D;, &#x201C;smart&#x201D; and &#x201C;sociable&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It was all a lie. I knew who I was. I was a loser. Still, it was <em>addicting</em>.</p>
<p>The emptiness left. In its place was something else&#x2014;something more addicting than any video game. I was high on momentum, high on growth and high on meaning.</p>
<p>And so it went. I fell over and got up again. Each time, I stood a little longer. I read more books. I started writing. I taught myself to program. I quit my job. I traveled.</p>
<p>These last two years were the best in my life.</p>
<p>Shit still happens. My girlfriend dumped me this year. I cried. I shaved my head. I got pissed off and threw my phone in a pond.</p>
<p>The itch comes back. <em>Come on, let&#x2019;s play. Just a little bit.</em> Sometimes, I laugh it away. Other times, it gets me.</p>
<p>But, whatever happens, my old friend fear is there to catch me. He gives me a kick in the ass. And I&#x2019;m back here going forward, climbing, getting better every day.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s to the next two years being even better.</p>
