					<p>Speed reading is great.</p>
<p>It sells a lot of <a href="http://amzn.to/2gCpT9h">books</a>&#xA0;and <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/">blog articles</a>.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s just one problem. It doesn&#x2019;t actually work.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a skeptic. I am always trying to ask: <i><strong>What is something most people believe that is wrong?</strong>&#xA0;</i>There are misconceptions everywhere: in investing (housing prices always go up), in health (saturated fat is bad), and in reading too (speed reading is possible).</p>
<p>I really, really want speed reading to work. I could be reading 600 books a year! But, when I looked at the evidence&#x2026;there wasn&#x2019;t any.</p>
<h2>The myth of speed reading</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;I took a speed-reading course and read War and Peace in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.&#x201D; &#xA0;</em><em>&#x2015;Woody Allen</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Speed reading texts try to sell the practice &#x201C;scientifically&#x201D; by offering the following techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate subvocalization (stop pronouncing words in your head)</li>
<li>Streamline eye movements (remove eye pauses to read faster)</li>
</ul>
<p>Two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subvocalization can&#x2019;t actually be eliminated</li>
<li>Streamlining eye movements reduces comprehension</li>
</ul>
<p>For more on this topic, see <a href="https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4229">this excellent article</a>&#xA0;by Skeptoid.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a lot of &#x201C;anecdotal&#xA0;evidence&#x201D; that now been debunked:</p>
<ul>
<li>John F. Kennedy reading 1000+ words per minute
<ul>
<li>This was a misquote by a reporter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legends of speed reading champions
<ul>
<li>People who didn&#x2019;t read the text scored equally well on speed reading tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, speed reading doesn&#x2019;t work.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what to do instead.</p>
<h2>What are you reading for?</h2>
<p>I will admit, I had the speed reading bug. I wanted to learn fast, and I thought the best way to do it was to read more. It took me many months (and a lot of wasted pages) to figure out that <b>it is not the volume of words but the volume of ideas that matter.</b></p>
<p>The problem with speed reading is that it uses words per minute (WPM) as a metric. Anyone who has tried to read a <i>real</i>&#xA0;book knows that this is bullshit. Try speed reading Plato. You will race through pages at 800 wpm, only to discover that you have absolutely no clue what the hell you spent the last hour looking at. Real writing often involves taking&#xA0;<i>a single page</i>&#xA0;and consuming it slowly, word by word.</p>
<h2>The&#xA0;two types of reading</h2>
<p>I do two types of reading: reading for information and reading for ideas.</p>
<p>The latter is much more useful in the long term &#x2014;<strong>I want to </strong>develop mental<strong> models that can continue to support me in 5, 20, or 50 years.</strong> Reading for information is often time-sensitive and less useful in the long term.</p>
<p>Yes, I can spend my time reading &#x201C;pop science&#x201D; books meant for ordinary audiences&#x2026;but the information density is so low. An entire 300-page book may only have a single quality idea. Compare this with Seneca&#x2019;s <i><a href="http://amzn.to/2fVebHA">Letters from a Stoic</a>&#xA0;</i>or Hayek&#x2019;s <i><a href="http://amzn.to/2gUljn4">The Fatal Conceit</a>&#xA0;&#x2014;</i>every other sentence in these books had me reaching for my pen.</p>
<p>Instead of using wpm as a positive indicator, try using it as a contrarian one. If your wpm is too high, perhaps the book or paper you are reading is too simple. Time to find something more stimulating, more worth your time.</p>
<p>Remember, it is never the volume, but the <i>signal </i>that we decision-makers are interested in.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Magic dust&#x201D; approaches like speed-reading are rarely as appealing as they first appear.</p>
