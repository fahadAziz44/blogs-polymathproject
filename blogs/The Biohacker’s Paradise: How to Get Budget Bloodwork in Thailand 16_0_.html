					<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I just finished a round of blood testing in Chiang Mai, Thailand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A dozen tests for key biomarkers of health, performance and aging plus a complete allergy panel (70+ tests). All for less than 25% of prices back home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can get all sorts of high quality tests (or operations, if that&#x2019;s your thing) done in Thailand at a fraction of time and price it would cost back home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyone interested in optimizing performance should be tracking biomarkers.The problem is, blood work costs thousands of dollars back home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, compare costs for a complete allergy profile:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the US: $318</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In Thailand: $75</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That&#x2019;s over $200 in savings <i>for a single test</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Benefits of testing in Thailand:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Extremely safe and high quality</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Prices at less than 25% of back home</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Fast results in your inbox (often within 24 hours)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">No wait time (I was in and out in 15 minutes)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you&#x2019;re considering comprehensive testing, here&#x2019;s how the prices can differ:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>The cost of comprehensive blood work plus allergy panel:</b> $2000-$5000</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>The cost of the same tests in Thailand:</b> $500-$1000</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That&#x2019;s thousands of dollars saved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why not use that money and add in a vacation?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even with a flight to Thailand, you&#x2019;re still saving hundreds. That&#x2019;s enough to pay for several weeks of good fun <i>and</i> get your blood work done. (For vanity purposes, I recommend getting tested <i>before</i> the partying starts.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#x2019;s a sample itinerary:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Cost of plane ticket from San Francisco, California: $600-$900.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Cost of testing: $500-$1000</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Cost of accommodation (one week) at a nice hotel: $200-$500</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Cost of food: $150-$250</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Total base cost: $1450-$2650</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Where to get your tests</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to get tests done, I recommend you&#xA0;avoid labs and go directly to the labs. Wait times are shorter in the labs, and the prices are up to 50% cheaper.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lab I use: <a href="http://www.brianet.com/en/"><span class="s2">Bria Labs</span></a></span></p>
<h2 class="p1">What tests to get</h2>
<p>There are a lot of tests, and I suggest you do your own research (everyone should have a basic education in this stuff), but some things to look at for starters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete Blood Count (CBC)</li>
<li>Thyroid function (TSH, Free T3, Free T4, TPO)</li>
<li>Lipid panel: (cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, VLDL)</li>
<li>Hormones: (Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone, Estradiol, GH stimulation tests, IGH-1, SHBG)</li>
<li>Inflammation markers:&#xA0;Homocysteine, HbA1c</li>
<li>Vitamin D (OH test, not the older stuff)</li>
<li>Magnesium (red blood cell, not serum)</li>
<li>Zinc (red blood cell, not serum)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, here are some heuristics if you don&#x2019;t know what to test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting 1+ hour of exposure to sunlight on a daily basis?
<ul>
<li>If not, you are probably deficient in Vitamin D.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you wake up in the morning with an erection? (Men only, obviously)
<ul>
<li>If not, you probably have low testosterone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you wake up every morning with vivid dreams?
<ul>
<li>If not, you are probably deficient in magnesium</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#x2019;re running on a budget and only get a few tests, here is a question you can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the 20% of tests that will &#x201C;catch&#x201D; 80%+ of problems?
<ul>
<li>For example, only testing total testosterone could be a budget substitute for an entire hormonal panel. You might also want to look at high impact areas where the majority of the population is deficient (Vitamin D, tec.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy testing &#x1F642;</p>
