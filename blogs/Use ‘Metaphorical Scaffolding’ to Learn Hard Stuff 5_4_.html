<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>When you see a talented sociologist, theoretical physicist, or computer programmer, what they do looks a lot like Balinese dark magic, something beyond the reach of an ordinary human.</span></span></p>
<p>But this isn&#x2019;t true. Sure, some people are smarter than others, but&#x2014;when<span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>&#xA0;you peek behind the curtain&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no magic going on.&#xA0;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Or, as the MIT mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota puts it, <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html#tricks">each mathematician only has a few tricks</a></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">&#x201C;A long time ago an older and well known number theorist made some disparaging remarks about Paul Erdos&#x2019; work. &#x2026; I felt annoyed when the older mathematician flatly and definitively stated that all of Erdos&#x2019; work could be reduced to a few tricks which Erdos repeatedly relied on in his proofs. What the number theorist did not realize is that <span class><strong>other mathematicians, even the very best, also rely on a few tricks which they use over and over</strong></span>.&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>High-level thinkers are not dark magicians&#x2014;they&#x2019;re smart-but-otherwise-ordinary people who&#x2019;ve picked up some interesting tricks.</span></span></p>
<p>In this essay, I want to dissolve some of the mysticism that surrounds high-level thinking.</p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">The Wrong Wetware</h2>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">It&#x2019;s a common belief that ideas from, say, quantum physics or behavioral neuroscience are headache-inducing and hard to understand. This is true, but it took me years to realize its true for <span class><em>everyone</em></span>&#x2014;this stuff is <span class><em>supposed</em></span><span class> to be hard to understand, even for experts.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Or, as the Nobel-winner Richard Feynman said, &#x201C;I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.&#x201D; </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Scientists are just as bad as you or me when dealing with abstract concepts. Here&#x2019;s Australian theoretical physicist Michael Nielsin in </span><span class><em><a spellcheck="false" href="http://www.michaelnielsen.org/blog/archive/tough-learning/tough-learning-final.html">Extreme Thinking</a></em></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em><span class>&#x201C;&#x2026;most scientists aren&#x2019;t much better than average at when it comes to intuitively working with such abstractions. We&#x2019;re stuck with the same equipment as everybody else. That, you see, is the special challenge that faces the scientist: using equipment not cut out for understanding abstract concepts to understand a Universe whose fundamental laws are abstract concepts.&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>By &#x201C;equipment&#x201D;, Nielsen is talking about what hackers sometimes call &#x201C;wetware&#x201D;&#x2014;our brain and the other &#x201C;wet&#x201D; parts of our biology that we use to understand and interact with the world.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>It&#x2019;s easy to for me to forget that humankind is still really, really young. Brutus gutted Caesar with a knife only 60-70 generations ago, and it&#x2019;s probably been only ~300 generations since our nomadic ancestors decided to stop chasing deer and settle down to grow crops.</span></span></p>
<p>In other words, our bodies aren&#x2019;t &#x2018;designed&#x2019; for modern life at all.</p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>We humans didn&#x2019;t evolve to think about cryptocurrency, orthogonal matrices, or interplanetary space travel, which means this stuff is really, really hard for us:</span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;&#x2026;there is no reason to suppose the laws of Nature are particularly accessible to the human mind. <span class><strong>The mind developed as a way of furthering competition with our fellow living beings, and only incidentally to understand the laws of the Universe.</strong></span> It&#x2019;s good at recognizing faces, making tools, and understanding social situations. It&#x2019;s not good at solving mathematical equations or other abstract reasoning. In doing science we are borrowing equipment developed for another purpose, and we should not be surprised if sometimes the equipment is not cut out for the task.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Here&#x2019;s a simple example of how hard some ideas are to understand: Try to imagine a six-dimensional space. Tried? Okay, well it&#x2019;s impossible. It&#x2019;s not just impossible for you&#x2014;it&#x2019;s impossible for <span class><em>everyone</em></span>, including theoretical physicists.</span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">But theoretical physicists <span class><em>do</em></span><span class> think in six dimensions all the time. So how do they do it? </span></span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true"><span class>Jerry-Rigging the Mind</span></h2>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>I wish we learned about this evolution-modernity mismatch in school, but I didn&#x2019;t. The first book to clue me in on it was Harvard linguist Steven Pinker&#x2019;s book </span><span class><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2MVbJ0j">The Blank Slate</a></em></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em><span class>&#x201C;Some of our perplexities may come from a mismatch between the purposes for which our cognitive faculties evolved and the purposes to which we put them today. &#x2026; Our minds keep us in touch with aspects of reality&#x2014;such as objects, animals, and people&#x2014;that our ancestors dealt with for millions of years. But as science and technology open up new and hidden worlds, our untutored intuitions may find themselves at sea.&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Humans weren&#x2019;t &#x2018;designed&#x2019; to understand stuff like linear algebra, Darwinian evolution, Austrian economics, or genome sequencing. We need special techniques to figure this stuff out:</span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;&#x2026;we have no mental tools to grasp [these subjects] intuitively. <span class><strong>We depend on analogies that press an old mental faculty into service, or on jerry-built mental contraptions that wire together bits and pieces of other faculties</strong></span>. Understanding in these domains is likely to be uneven, shallow, and contaminated by primitive intuitions.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Notice that Pinker mentions (a) analogies and (b) &#x201C;mental contraptions&#x201D;.</span> </span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">These two tools are a key to understanding not only how to better understand hard ideas but also how we humans manage to think&#xA0;<span class><em>at all</em></span><span class>.</span></span></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s Metaphors All the Way Down</p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class="md-image md-img-loaded" contenteditable="false" data-src="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/ff/pixels.png"><img src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/ff/pixels.png?ssl=1" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/f/ff/pixels.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Remember metaphors? If you&#x2019;re like me, you heard your English teacher say stuff like &#x201C;Laughter is the music of the soul&#x201D; or &#x201C;His heart is a cold iron&#x201D; and thought, &#x201C;Nope, no thank you. This is kooky, cringey, and completely useless. Time to take a nap.&#x201D;</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>But it turns out metaphors aren&#x2019;t just for English teachers, poets, and singer-songwriters. Metaphors are for everyone, because they are the way we understand anything </span><span class><em>at all</em></span><span class>.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Here&#x2019;s Kevin Simler&#x2014;one of my favorite bloggers&#x2014;in </span><span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://meltingasphalt.com/honesty-and-the-human-body/"><em>Honesty and the Human Body</em></a></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;The body &#x2026; precedes language and abstract thought during individual development. A child first comes to know the world through his or her body, and later developmental steps build on top of that understanding. As <a href="https://amzn.to/2tz3Vsr">George Lakoff argues</a>, <span class><strong>our capacity for abstract thought is grounded in (conceptual) metaphor. We reason about abstract domains in terms of more concrete, embodied domains</strong></span>. &#x2018;The very words which form the building blocks of explicit thought are themselves all originally metaphors, grounded in the human body and its experience,&#x2019; <a href="https://amzn.to/2trZhNy">writes Iain McGilchrist</a>, channeling Lakoff.&#x201D; </em></span></p></blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Basically, we understand ideas in terms of <span class><em>other</em></span> ideas. To understand an abstract concept like &#x201C;love&#x201D; we need a bunch of metaphors like JOURNEY, MADNESS, WAR, and so on.</span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>But, if you think about it, our big love-web can&#x2019;t just be a mass of interwoven metaphors floating in outer space. Metaphors have to come from somewhere. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Well, this &#x201C;somewhere&#x201D; happens to be <span class><em>our bodies</em></span>.</span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Bodily experience is all we have, and we have to use these experiences to try and understand difficult, strategy ideas. Humans operate in three-dimensions&#x2014;this makes six-dimensional thinking pretty hard. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>The answer&#x2014;as Pinker pointed out earlier&#x2014;is to (a) using analogies [which come from experience] and wire together &#x201C;Jerry-built mental contraptions&#x201D;. Turns out, we can use a whole bunch of metaphors together to help understand difficult, abstract ideas.</span></span></p>

<p class>I try to understand this by thinking of <span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>story about the Chinese blind men that are all rubbing up on an elephant, trying to guess what it is they are touching:</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class="md-image md-img-loaded" contenteditable="false" data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Blind_men_and_elephant3.jpg"><img src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Blind_men_and_elephant3.jpg?ssl=1" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Blind_men_and_elephant3.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>If they communicate well, they might get a pretty good idea of what the elephant looks like, but never a perfect one.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>What&#x2019;s more, the more complex and abstract an idea is, the more metaphors we&#x2019;ll need to &#x201C;stack&#x201D; on top of each other to understand it. This is probably why quantum mechanics is so damn hard to understand&#x2014;it&#x2019;s really, really far away from our natural, embodied, caveman way of understanding the world.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>To stretch the analogy, imagine if the team of blind men went next door to the School for the Deaf and tried to communicate (via sign language, I guess) what it was that they had &#x201C;rubbed up on.&#x201D; It&#x2019;d be pretty hard.</span></span></p>
<p>Anyway, another<span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>&#xA0;way to help master abstract ideas is to give them a sexy name. Let&#x2019;s do that now. I&#x2019;m gonna call this&#xA0;</span><span class><strong>metaphorical scaffolding</strong></span>&#x2014;you can &#x2018;stack&#x2019; metaphors on top of one another to help &#x2018;reach&#x2019; an understanding of difficult ideas. </span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Sounds pretty sexy to me&#x2026; But I&#x2019;m Asian &#x1F609;</span></span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true"><span class>Back to Practice</span></h2>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Okay, enough theory. Let&#x2019;s switch to some field work&#x2014;how does <span class><strong>metaphorical scaffolding</strong></span><span class> work in practice?</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Let me share a quick example from a <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys4810/phys4810_fa08/4810_readings/vh1.pdf">paper</a></span><span class> in the American Journal of Physics.

<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">Teasing Students</h2>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>First, let&#x2019;s explore (read: make fun of) how amateur students try to solve problems.&#xA0;</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Unsurprisingly, most students come out of college physics just as useless as when they went in:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Students, at the end of their conventional study, have little structure to their knowledge. <span class><strong>Their understanding consists of random facts and equations that have little conceptual meaning.</strong></span><span class> When given a problem, they identify some structural feature described in the problem (an inclined plane, a rope, a spring, etc.). They then search randomly for and inappropriately use an equation they associate with that feature.&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>This is the classic &#x201C;plug and chug&#x201D; problem solving that we learned to do in school. Any small shift in context destroys your ability to think&#x2014;this is the opposite of what we want. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">So how do pro physicists do it differently?</span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true"><span class>How Pro Physicists Think</span></h2>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Remember our sexy word &#x2018;metaphorical scaffolding&#x2019;? Well keep that in mind as you read this:</span></span></p>

<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>For years and years, I thought relying on diagrams &amp; intuition was a weakness, a crutch for the not-smart-enough.

<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em><span class>&#x201C;We are at the very&#xA0;beginning&#xA0;of&#xA0;time&#xA0;for the&#xA0;human&#xA0;race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with&#xA0;problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the&#xA0;future. Our&#xA0;responsibility&#xA0;is to do what we can,&#xA0;learn&#xA0;what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
