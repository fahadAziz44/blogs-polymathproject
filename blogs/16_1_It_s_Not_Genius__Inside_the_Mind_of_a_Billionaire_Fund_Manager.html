					<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Stanley Druckenmiller is a legend of the finance world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">A small investment of $1000 when his fund opened would have grown to $2.6 million over the next 30 years.</span></p>
<p>Druckenmiller is best known as right-hand man to George Soros&#x2014;the most celebrated trader and hedge fund manager in all of history. In 1992, Soros made $1 billion in a single day with his bet the British pound sterling. Druckenmiller was right there next to him.</p>
<p>How did Druckenmiller achieve his success?</p>
<p>Perhaps he was born with it?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: inherit;">It&#x2019;s Not Genius</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m no genius. I was not in the top 10 percent of my high school class. My SATs were so mediocre I went to Bowdoin because it was the only school that didn&#x2019;t require SATs, and it turned out to be a very fortunate event for me.&#x201D;</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">I&#x2019;ve seen this across top-level thinkers in many fields. Test scores and grades in school are not a good predictor of success. Actually,&#xA0;<i>good grades can be a&#xA0;countersignal</i>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Traditional schooling is fixed and inorganic. To reach the top 1% of standardized testing requires you to play by house rules (and have a high tolerance for the boring). </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">This transfers poorly to the real world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;"> If you want to find the next generation&#x2019;s true leaders, don&#x2019;t search the highest layer.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br>
</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Genetics and raw intellect get too much attention; there&#x2019;s a lot more at play here.</span></p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s dig in&#x2026;</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: inherit;">1. Have Incredible Passion</span></h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">&#x201C;The thought that every event in the world affects some security price somewhere I just found incredibly intellectually [stimulating] to try and figure out what the next puzzle was and what was going to move what.&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">You often hear stories of fund managers working 100+ hour weeks. </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Even more incredibly, these guys are doing this out their own volition. No time cards, no hourly salary &#x2013; just pure obsession. And they enjoy every moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">You do not get ahead by doing things half-assed.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: inherit;">2. Find Great Mentors</span></h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re early on in your career and they give you a choice between a great mentor or higher pay, take the mentor every time.&#xA0;</span>It&#x2019;s not even close.<span style="font-weight: normal;">&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></span></p></blockquote>
<div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Too many people make the mistake of&#xA0;<i>not investing in human capital</i>. </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0in;"></div>
<div style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">No intelligent investor would take short term money over a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. </span>But young ones do this all the time. The good guys do not. Warren Buffett went to his mentor, Benjamin Graham. Likewise, Stanley Druckenmiller went to George Soros.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in;"></div>
<div style="margin: 0in;">If you are young (or old), the best thing you can do is invest in yourself.</div>
<h2><span style="font-family: inherit;">3. Go for the Jugular&#xA0;</span></h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">&#x201C;If you really see [an opportunity], put all your eggs in one basket and watch the basket very carefully.&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Humans are naturally risk averse. In the jungle, risk aversion works: see lion and run away. Unfortunately, these instincts don&#x2019;t carry well to the modern world.</p>
<p>We are always finding ways to get &#x201C;job stability&#x201D; or &#x201C;reduce stress&#x201D;. Common wisdom says, &#x201C;never put all your eggs in one basket&#x201D;. We spread ourselves thin, cultivate a fear of failure and cease to believe in ourselves.</p>
<p>Then, when the opportunity of a lifetime comes, we let it go&#x2026;</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t make that mistake. Learn to make hard decisions. Then, when the time comes,&#xA0;<em>make them</em>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Takeaways</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here are the takeaways again: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Be obsessed with what you do.</b></li>
<li><strong>Pass on the cash. Go study with your heroes instead.</strong></li>
<li><b>If you see an opportunity, don&#x2019;t be afraid to &#x201C;go for the jugular&#x201D;.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You might have hundreds of ideas in a year. Only two or three those will be any good. Learn to &#x201C;filter&#x201D; ideas into tiers of bad (avoid), decent (small time investment) and great (go all out). Allocate your time accordingly. Profit &#x1F642;</p>
