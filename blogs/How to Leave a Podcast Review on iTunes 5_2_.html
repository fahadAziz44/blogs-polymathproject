					<p>Hi, Charles here. Thanks for listening to the podcast.</p>
<p>Honest reviews on iTunes are one of the best things you can do to support a new show. This is a visual guide to how to do that. Again, this stuff costs nothing and you&#x2019;ll be done in just a few minutes.</p>
<h2>Do you have an Apple ID?</h2>
<p>First, you&#x2019;ll need Apple ID, which is the account you need to use pretty much anything Apple-related, including iTunes.&#xA0;<strong>If you own any Apple device or have used iTunes before, you can skip this section </strong>(because you already have an ID)<strong>.&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t have an Apple ID yet, visit <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/account">this link</a>&#xA0;to create one.</p>
<p>You&#x2019;ll end up at a page like this:</p>

<p>You&#x2019;ll need to fill out some basic personal information, make security questions, etc. You know, the usual stuff.</p>
<p>After that, you&#x2019;ll be asked to enter some payment information (CC or PayPal) but&#xA0;<em>you won&#x2019;t be charged for anything</em>. This is just for registration purposes. And yes, I know it&#x2019;s a pain in the butt.</p>
<h2>Visit the Podcast Page</h2>
<p>Once you have an Apple ID, the rest is easy.</p>
<p>First, you visit the page for the podcast you want to review (link to The Polymath Project here).</p>
<p>You&#x2019;ll end up at a browser page like this:</p>
