					<p>I&#x2019;ve decided. I&#x2019;m writing a book.</p>
<p>Readers of this blog know that&#x2014;for any big project&#x2014;I always study major successes and failures first to search for common threads.</p>
<p>This project is no exception. I&#x2019;m not one to weave a random idea into a book, throw it out into the Internet and then pray it sells.</p>
<p>Today, I&#x2019;m studying a recent self-publishing success: Taylor Pearson&#x2019;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2fDufgQ">The End of Jobs</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some of Taylor&#x2019;s results in the first 6 months after his booked launched:</p>
<ul>
<li>5,000 copies sold in the 1st month, with 30,000 copies in circulation in the first 6 months</li>
<li>#1 Amazon Best Seller (in Business and Money Category)</li>
<li>$60k+ in revenue from book sales</li>
</ul>
<p>To make matters more impressive, <strong>Taylor wrote, marketed and launched his book in 9 months.</strong> He had no significant audience or funding to start.</p>
<p>How did he do this?</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s dig in&#x2026;</p>
<h1>Structure of a Book Launch</h1>
<p>The 9 months of effort prior to Taylor&#x2019;s book launch can be roughly divided into the following 3 phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draft phase (writing only)</li>
<li>Editing phase (50/50 writing and marketing)</li>
<li>Marketing phase (marketing and branding only)</li>
</ol>
<p>Notably, the earliest phase is writing-centric. This shifts more and more to the marketing side as the launch draws near.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s look at each of the phases in more detail.</p>
<h1>1. The Draft Phase</h1>
<p>The main goals of this phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a book idea. You should have a clear problem you are trying to solve BEFORE writing.</li>
<li>Write a (shitty) first draft that is entirely driven by word count</li>
<li>Get feedback from your inner circle (2-5 close friends)</li>
</ul>
<p>The writing tool Taylor used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> &#x2014; A writing app designed for longer books. Let&#x2019;s you sell overall and daily word count goals.</li>
</ul>
<h1>2. The Editing Phase</h1>
<p>Upon entering this phase, Taylor split his efforts between marketing and writing. The mornings (his &#x201C;prime hours&#x201D;) were spent writing while the afternoons were spent on marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Taylor&#x2019;s editing phase was divided into 3 editing sessions. Each session was 4 weeks long.</p>
<p>The structure of each session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take feedback from alpha readers</li>
<li>Do a structural edit (reorganizing chapters, etc.) using reader feedback</li>
<li>Do a &#x2018;writerly&#x2019; edit (improving prose, etc.) using reader feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of three editing sessions, Taylor had a finished draft that was ready to go to beta readers and his editor.</p>
<p>Taylor also began his marketing campaign at this time. The most important lessons from Taylor&#x2019;s approach is how he &#x201C;baked in&#x201D; the marketing to his book launch.</p>
<p>Some tactics that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>He interviewed many people for his book. These people naturally went on to promote the launch.</li>
<li>He used blog posts to create a narrative around his book (behind the scenes look at the writing process, etc.)</li>
<li>He directly published parts of draft chapters to test for traction, build anticipation and get direct reader feedback</li>
<li>He set up a &#x201C;tribe&#x201D; via a landing page and Facebook group. These tribe members would go on to provide a large portion of his initial Amazon reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h1>3. The Launch Phase</h1>
<p>This is the most tactical of the three phases.</p>
<p>Concentrating &#xA0;all sales in the first few days of launch is crucial for reaching &#x201C;escape velocity&#x201D;&#x2014;the state where sales begin to come naturally.</p>
<p>Taylor promoted the launch through three major channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guest posts</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li><a href="Thunderclap.it">Thunderclap.it</a> &#x2014; Allows supporters to schedule tweets / shares to launch all at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>He set these up to launch at the same time (immediately upon book release). This tactic leverages the recency effect: a coordinated launch appears more significant than a spread out one.</p>
<p>A few other important tactics he used:</p>
<ul>
<li>He offered the book for free for the first five days of the launch. Everyone who signed up pre-launch also got a free copy.</li>
<li>He gave pre-launch copies out early so that readers would have time to read and write reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Takeaways</h1>
<p>Taylor&#x2019;s shows what is possible when a first-time author with limited funding and network and accomplish with a tactical approach.</p>
<p>Two more takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a lot more things that Taylor could have done to &#x201C;optimize&#x201D; his launch. But he didn&#x2019;t need to. All you need to do is (1) get a few important things right and (2) avoid the mistakes that 95%+ of authors make.</li>
<li>None of this matters if your book idea sucks. The purpose of a launch is exactly that&#x2014;to give an idea the momentum it needs to stay afloat. No amount of launching is going to keep a rock in the air.</li>
</ul>
