					<p>Many consider Peter Drucker the most influential thinker in the history of management.</p>
<p>Which is great, if you are a manager.</p>
<p>But what if you&#x2019;re not? What if you&#x2019;re a freelancer, an office grunt, or just a hermit living in the woods? Can Drucker still help you?</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s one thing that everyone has to manage. It&#x2019;s something very close to us&#x2014;ourselves.</p>
<p>For Drucker, this self-management starts with time.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2nX02t6">The Essential Drucker</a></em>&#x2014;an excellent intro to Drucker&#x2019;s prolific writings (over 30 books!)&#x2014;there&#x2019;s an entire chapter devoted to his method of time management.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve used a variant Drucker&#x2019;s method on and off for a while now. When I do use it, I am a productive beast, averaging 7-8 hours of quality work a day. When I don&#x2019;t, I average 2-3 hours&#x2014;no better than the average American.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s take a look at Drucker&#x2019;s method.</p>
<h1>Why Time?</h1>
<p>I have a friend who never runs out of startup ideas. Every few weeks, he sends me an excited message that goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>HEYYYY MANNN! I&#x2019;ve got this AWESOME idea. Nobody&#x2019;s thought of it. There&#x2019;s an inefficiency in the market. All I have to do is exploit it, and BAM!!!!11!!! It&#x2019;s gonna be the next Facebook!&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yea, man. You got this.</p>
<p>Five years later, there&#x2019;s still only one Facebook. And this friend is still teaching English.</p>
<p>What&#x2019;s wrong here?</p>
<p>Well, a lot is wrong. But, according to Drucker, the most obvious mistake is that <em>he is starting in the wrong place:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;Effective knowledge workers, in my observation, do not start with their tasks. They start with their time.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>I see this often. People make intricate plans for diets, businesses, or world travel and, well, none of it happens. It&#x2019;s a pleasant fantasy. If you want results instead of fantasies, the first step is to <em>start executing</em>.</p>
<p>And execution starts by mastering your time.</p>
<h1>The Three Steps to Master Your Time</h1>
<p>Drucker&#x2019;s method can be roughly divided into three steps.</p>
<p>The first step is to <em>understand</em>.</p>
<h2>1. Record Your Time</h2>
<p>If you&#x2019;re like me, you probably read &#x201C;record your time&#x201D; and thought something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pshhhh. Are you kidding? I&#x2019;m me. ME. I lived it, so I know where my time goes. Why bother to track it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Our minds are fickle, says Drucker:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;Man is ill-equipped to manage his time. Even in total darkness, most people retain their sense of space. But even with the lights on, a few hours in a sealed room render most people incapable of estimating how much time has elapsed. [&#x2026;] If we rely on our memory, therefore, we do not know how time has been spent.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>The only way to stay honest is to track <em>in the moment</em>.<br>
There are countless ways to do this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;The specific method in which the record is put together need not concern us here. &#x2026; <strong>The important thing is that it gets done, and that the record is made in &#x201C;real&#x201D; time&#x2026;</strong>&#x201C;</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#x2019;t matter how you do it. Just make sure that you do.</p>
<p>Here are some ways you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate</strong> the tracking with <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/rp/milo">RescueTime</a>. (Note: This only works well if you spend most of your day at your computer.)</li>
<li><strong>Semi-automate</strong> using a digital time-tracker like <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a></li>
<li><strong>Outsource</strong> it to your secretary or VA.</li>
<li><strong>Track manually</strong> with a spreadsheet or good &#x2018;ol pen and paper</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I track on paper and record everything to a spreadsheet at the end of the day. Drucker recommends doing this for 3-4 weeks. I think 1 is probably enough, for starters.</p>
<p>Either way, take your records and&#x2026;</p>
<h2>2. Diagnose Your Time</h2>
<p>The next step is to analyze your records.</p>
<p>Nobody spends their time perfectly, says Drucker:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;I have yet to see a knowledge worker, <em>regardless of rank or station</em>, who could not consign something like a quarter of the demands on his time to the wastepaper basket without anybody&#x2019;s noticing their disappearance.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>I find that, without time-tracking, more than half of my time goes towards &#x201C;useless&#x201D; activities. (<em>Note that is <em>work</em> time. Whether or not to track your social life is a topic for another time.</em>)</p>
<p>The goal during this step is to figure out where time is being wasted. To help figure it out, Drucker gives two questions we can ask.</p>
<p><strong>Question One:</strong> &#x201C;What would happen if this were not done at all?&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;[Ask:] What would happen if this were not done at all? And if the answer is, Nothing would happen, then obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is pretty straightforward. If you think something might be useless, take it out and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Question Two:</strong> &#x201C;What activities could someone else do better?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I get stuck here a lot. I tend to think I can do things better than anybody else. Even if that&#x2019;s true (it&#x2019;s not), that&#x2019;s not the point.</p>
<p>The point is that <em>I do some things better than other things.</em> It makes sense to delegate, outsource, automate things that I am less good at so I can do more of what I excel at.</p>
<p>Some things you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate</strong> repeated tasks using apps like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> or <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize</strong> work done repeatedly by creating an &#x201C;Operations Checklist.&#x201D; (See Marshall&#x2019;s <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2oSiFCi">Progression</a></em> for more on how to do this.)</li>
<li><strong>Outsource</strong> by hiring a freelancer to do things that you are less good at (scheduling, babysit, web design, walk the dog, outreach, marketing, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Consolidate Your Time</h2>
<p>Step two was about finding wasted time and eliminating it. But there&#x2019;s another way to manage your time: you can <em>reorganize it</em>.</p>
<p>A one-hour block is not the same as ten six-minute blocks. High-level creative work needs around two hours of focus. If you&#x2019;re always interrupted by meetings (or kids), no real work&#xA0;will happen.</p>
<p>Drucker recommends that we &#x201C;block off&#x201D; at least a quarter of our day to do private, focused work:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;Even one-quarter of the working day, if consolidated in large time units, is usually enough to get the important things done.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>If your work is highly creative (writing, etc.), you might need to block off a lot more.</p>
<h1>One Last Thing</h1>
<p>Try doing the above three things for a few weeks. I&#x2019;ve seen impressive results from it.</p>
<p>But there&#x2019;s a caveat.</p>
<p>This is not one of the things that you just do once in a lifetime. Without periodic attention, we &#x201C;decay&#x201D; to our old selves, says Drucker:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;&#x2026;effective executives have the log run on themselves for three to four weeks at a stretch twice a year or so, on a regular schedule.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
