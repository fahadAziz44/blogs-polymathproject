					<p>One of my good friends (let&#x2019;s call her Linda) is struggling with a terrible problem&#x2013;her life is too interesting and she doesn&#x2019;t know what to do about it.</p>
<p>Linda&#x2019;s question for me:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#x201C;How many goals can someone realistically pursue at one time? &#x2026;there&#x2019;s so much I want to learn &#x2013; writing, marketing, dance, Spanish&#x2026; how to best go about it without falling apart and giving up?&#x201D;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>My answer is below.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Dear Linda,</p>
<p>You&#x2019;re really excited about your future. There&#x2019;s so much you want to learn&#x2014;so much, in fact, that you don&#x2019;t know where to start. Congratulations! That&#x2019;s much better than being bored. And, even better, <em>you are aware of the common pitfalls.</em><br>
<em><br>
</em>Most people get inspired for some goal, sprint at max effort for 1-2 weeks, burn out, push the goal into the back of their mind, and never touch it again. New Year&#x2019;s resolutions are a classic example.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can offer some words to improve your chances of success.</p>
<h3>First things first&#x2014;check your bases.</h3>
<div></div>
<p>You mentioned you want to learn many things. That&#x2019;s great. The first thing you should do is touch base with yourself. Ask: &#x201C;Is what I want what I want?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sometimes, we lie to ourselves about what we want. Other times, we are being deceived and we don&#x2019;t even know it. We might want to do something because of vanity, because our neighbors are doing it, because of our self-identity, or because of some long-held &#x2018;dream&#x2019; grasped claw-handed from childhood.</p>
<p>Begin by doubting yourself. <b>Find the things you actually want&#x2013;not the things you say you want.&#xA0;</b>It will save a lot of time in the long run.</p>
<h3>Reflect and make space.</h3>
<p>Next, you need to make space. Before you decided to change, your day was already full of <i>somethings</i>. You slept, ate, work and did <em>stuff</em>&#x2014;24 hours a day, every day. To make room for new things, something else will have to go. There is always a sacrifice.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we would go into our day, surgically remove the habits, activities, people and work <em>least</em> in line with our goals and add in only those things <em>most</em> in line with them. Sadly, behavioral change isn&#x2019;t quite that precise. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean we can&#x2019;t be systematic about it.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;d do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Track.</strong> Figure out what your typical day looks like: when you woke up, when you went to work, how many hours you spent on task A, B, C, etc. and what time you went to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dissect.</strong> Figure out what you can sacrifice. Are you wasting time on the Internet? Are there low-quality people in your life? What are the 10-20% of activities that are making up 80%+ of your empty, meaningless time?</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replace.</strong> Notice I didn&#x2019;t say add. Adding is hard&#x2014;you were already using all 24 hours before, remember? You can&#x2019;t exactly live on 25 hours. Much better is to replace. I&#x2019;ve written about this before, but the basic protocol is: (1) identify the trigger for the activity or habit you want to replace, (2) spent 1-2 weeks &#x201C;re-programming&#x201D; that trigger to your new, more beneficial activity.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>Again, remember that <em>making space is hard.</em> You will only be able to do one new thing, two at most.<br>
Choose the most important thing, spend 1-2 weeks making that practice into a habit, then repeat the above process for new changes you want to make.</p>
<p>Okay, but how to choose the &#x201C;most important thing?&#x201D; By choosing the lead domino.</p>
<h3>Choose the lead domino.</h3>
<div></div>
<p>I heard of this concept from Tim Ferriss. When you have a lot of interesting things ahead of you and you don&#x2019;t know what to choose, <strong>choose the thing that makes everything easier.</strong> If you want to run a marathon, you might want to start by quitting smoking first. If you want to be a martial artist, you might want to &#x201C;bulletproof&#x201D; your joints against injury so you can train harder.</p>
<p>This obviously requires an exercise in imagination. You need to be able to see second order and third order effects&#x2014;how certain skills, habits and life changes cascade into future changes and how those future changes keep snowball into even more changes down the line.</p>
<h3>A few more tools before you go.</h3>
<div></div>
<p>I&#x2019;ve got a lot more to say about this, but I&#x2019;ll have to flesh it out another time. Let me give you a few tidbits to get the creative juices flowing, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim for a 80% success rate.</strong> Humans learn best when they are optimally challenged. This happens somewhere around 80%. Keep track of your weekly practice goals, and aim to achieve them 5-6 days a week. If you&#x2019;re under that, you&#x2019;re being too aggressive. If you had a perfect week, maybe it&#x2019;s time to add some more challenge to your life.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work in phases.</strong> When you&#x2019;ve spent 4-6 weeks on some skill, seen considerable improvement, and progress has slowed, it makes sense to put that skill aside to work on a new one. Even better if this new skill has synergistic effects on your old one. Maybe you were working on writing and now you&#x2019;re going to work on public speaking. Maybe you take a break from dance to work on yoga.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Put skills on maintenance.</strong> Hidden law of the universe: <em>changing is a lot harder than staying the same.</em> Useful side effect of this law of the universe: <em>putting skills on maintenance requires very little effort.</em> This is why athletes can retain muscle mass despite dropping training to 10% of previous levels. This is why someone can still speak Japanese despite working on it much less than they used to.
<ul>
<li>It takes very little, maybe 15 minutes 3 times a week, to maintain a skill. This prevents regression, which is costly. Forgetting a language and then relearning it costs a lot more than keeping it on maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deload.</strong> This is another concept from athletic training. Most high level athletes halve the amount of training they do every 4-6 weeks. This gives the body a chance to recover from pent-up stress and actually produces a wave of &#x201C;super compensation&#x201D; where the athlete reaps all the benefits from training during that rest and recovery period.
<ul>
<li>Try scheduling reloads for your own daily practice. Let to subconscious do its work. Go on vacation every one or two months. Take a day off. Read some fiction. You might find it easier to concentrate after you come back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>Hope that helps, Linda.</p>
<p><em>A lot of these concepts are still in their &#x201C;seed&#x201D; stage&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll be refining them, adding concrete protocols and publishing new stuff in long form over the coming weeks. Stay tuned.</em></p>
