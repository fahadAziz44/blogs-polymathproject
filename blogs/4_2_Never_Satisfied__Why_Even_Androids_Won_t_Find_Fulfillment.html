					<p>Amazon is great, but many of my favorite books still come from physical bookstores.</p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Last month at a Tokyo bookstore, I discovered Tomas Sedlacek&#x2019;s&#xA0;<span class><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Airts3">The Economics of Good and Evil</a></em></span><span class>. The book was a surprise bestseller in Czech, but I&#x2019;d never heard of it before.</span></span></p>
<p>The book helped upgrade my thinking around the following question: <em>&#x201C;Why the heck is it so hard to feel satisfied?&#x201D;</em></p>
<h2>Never Satisfied: A Brief Review</h2>
<p>First, let&#x2019;s do a quick review of why it&#x2019;s so hard to be satisfied.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">adapt to</a> almost anything we do or consume. This means that spending more or buying more may be&#x2014;in the long run&#x2014;effectively useless for making us happy or satisfied.</p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Here&#x2019;s Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman on the subject:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em><span class>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s really interesting to think about whether people are happier now than they were [in the past]. This is not at all obvious because people adapt and habituate to most of what they have. So, the question to consider about well-being and about providing various goods to people, is whether they&#x2019;re going to get used to having those goods, and whether they continue to enjoy those goods.&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economists used to think (and many of them still do, I guess) that, when we get rich enough, we&#x2019;d stop wanting more.</p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">That was a critical mistake, says Sedlacek:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Some time ago we thought that the more we will have, the less we will need or want. But here is where we made a major mistake. <span class><strong>Needs grow with what we have. We will never be satiated.</strong></span> &#x2026;demand (want, lust, craving) grows larger and larger with every new supply&#x2014;until, out of oversaturation, we could get into the situation described in Psalm 107: &#x2018;They loathed all food.&apos;&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>It get worse. It&#x2019;s typical to think that having more means needing less. But it may be the opposite&#x2014;having more means&#xA0;<em>needing even more:&#xA0;</em></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;We thought that consumption leads to saturation, the satiation of our needs. But the opposite has proven to be true. The more we have, the more additional things we need. It&#x2019;s enough to compare all that we did not need twenty years ago (computers, mobile telephones) with what we objectively need today (ultralight laptops, new mobile phones every two years, permanent and fast connection to the mobile internet). <span class><strong>While the rich should have fewer unfulfilled needs than the poor, the reality is turning out to be absolutely the opposite.</strong>&#x201C;</span></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing new here yet. I&#x2019;ve written about this before. I&#xA0;needed one more idea from Sedlacek&#x2019;s book to come to an important realization: These problems are really, really<em> old</em>.</p>
<h2>Old Lies That Tell the Truth</h2>

(Source: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/blackheart97/art/Pandora-s-Box-310122237">DeviantArt)</a></p></div>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>One theme of Sedlacek&#x2019;s book is that myths, stories, and fables capture &#x201C;truths&#x201D; about human experience.&#xA0;</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Take two classic stories that we&#x2019;re all familiar with: (a) the story of Pandora&#x2019;s box and (b) the story of Adam &amp; Eve&#x2019;s fall from paradise.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Both stories, says Sedlacek, tell us about how hard it is to find satisfaction:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;&#x2026;in both stories it was a desire, curiosity, especially an exaggerated demand and an insatiability, or, if you will, inadequacy that <span class>brought evil</span> to the earth. Eve and Adam could eat in abundance of &#x201C;every tree in the garden,&#x201D; but that was still <span class>not enough</span> for them. &#x2026; <span class><strong>These stories reveal something to us: Even if we have enough of everything and live in paradise, it will still not be enough for us</strong></span><span class>, and we will have a constant tendency &#x2026; to consume what we do not need to consume&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class>In&#xA0;<em><a href="https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/the-tantalus-problem-why-more-cannot-make-us-happy-e840978f1e4d">The Tantalus Problem: Why More Cannot Make Us Happy</a>, </em>I also wrote about the story of Tantalus:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;In Greek mythology, Tantalus was punished for eternity to stand in a pool of water that sat under a fruit tree. When he tried to pick the fruit, the branches would rise away from his fingers. When he bent down to drink, the waters would descend down out of his reach.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em><span class>&#x201C;No matter how much he struggled, he could not find his reward. Such is the fate of those that fall prey to the lures of wealth, consumerism,power. Happiness is always just out of reach.&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means to me is that o<em>ur ancestors struggled with same problems we did.&#xA0;</em>Pandora opened the box. Eve ate the fruit. For longer than we can remember, our ancestors have struggled with desire, and these struggles were captured in the form of myths and stories. Myths are lies that tell the truth.</p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>That&#x2019;s when I realized something. If these problems are so old and they&#x2019;ve been around since the dawn of time, then <strong>there&#x2019;s a chance that </strong></span><strong><span class>the problem can&#x2019;t be solved</span><em>.</em></strong></span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">&#x201C;Naturally Discontented&#x201D;</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Sedlacek argues that &#x201C;insaturability&#x201D; is a natural part of human nature. It&#x2019;s a never-ending story that we can&#x2019;t escape from:</span></p>
<blockquote class>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;I do not want to propose here that we give up our possessions but to show that this is a never-ending story. <span class><strong>We are naturally discontented&#x2014;as we have seen, insaturability is something that has been in human nature from its very beginning..</strong></span><span class>. It goes against human nature, [The 18th century German philosopher] Kant writes, &#x2018;to stop possessing and enjoying at some point and be satisfied.&apos;&#x201D;</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x2019;s nice, but it doesn&#x2019;t satisfy me (har, har). A<span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">nnoying kids like me always ask: <span class><em>&#x201C;Why? Why is it part of human nature? Why is the problem insoluble?&#x201D;</em></span></span></p>
<p>One interesting answer comes from<span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">&#xA0;Hurley &amp; Dennett&#x2019;s excellent book,&#xA0;<span class><em><a spellcheck="false" href="https://amzn.to/2uW9Vgf">Inside Jokes: Using Humor to Reverse Engineer the Mind</a></em></span>.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>In it, the authors ask a big question:&#xA0;<strong>Why did we evolve with such damaging behaviors like overreaction or addiction?</strong> Wouldn&#x2019;t that be counterproductive?</span></span></p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what they say:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t evolution provide us with the right emotional constitution to restrain us from engaging in these damaging behaviors? [New environmental challenges are] not the primary reason. Cheating and procrastination are age-old problems. And, though we might just chalk it up to evolutionary oversights &#x2026; there is another more convincing answer: <strong>Because it can&#x2019;t</strong>.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Ohohoho. Oh boy. </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Here&#x2019;s what I think Hurley is saying: <em>&#x201C;No, these aren&#x2019;t problems that, with enough prayers for grant money or enough sessions of intravenous hormone injections, we will be able solve. These problems are <span class>insoluble.</span></em><span class><em> They&#x2019;ll always be with us.&#x201D;</em> </span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>That&#x2019;s not to say we can&#x2019;t manage alcoholism or drug abuse. We can. But addictions&#x2014;in one form or another&#x2014;will always exist.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Now, back to the question: Why can&#x2019;t we solve the problem?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Well, if you think about it, many of our vices&#x2014;procrastination, binge eating, gambling, etc.&#x2014;all originate from emotions &amp; desires that were originally &#x201C;good&#x201D;.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>For example, laziness is good because it conserves energy, but it can turn into chronic procrastination. Eating sugar (in moderate amounts) is good because you need it to survive, but it can turn into overeating. And so on.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">What this means is that our emotions and urges are <span class><em>rational</em></span><span class>. They guide us toward things that promote survival. Curiosity gathers knowledge. Sugar cravings gather calories. Anger warns others that we should be respected.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Emotions are rational, but they also <span class><em>make mistakes</em></span><span class>. Our eyes do a wonderful job 99%+ of the time but sometimes we see optical illusions. Likewise, our emotions do a wonderful job for most of our life, but sometimes they go crazy.</span></span></p>
<p>We can&#x2019;t avoid mistakes. Why? Because we&#x2019;re small, weak beings and the world is really complicated. The emotions make &#x201C;educated guesses&#x201D; and sometimes those educated guesses go wrong. There&#x2019;s no way around it.</p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Or, as the authors puts it (in slightly more sophisticated language):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em><span class>&#x201C;The emotions are rational, but the system is a heuristic driver of behavior that operates on incomplete information; so </span><span class><strong>we must accept that emotions will fail us in some ways, such as overreactions and addictions, that are irresolvable</strong></span>.&#x201D;</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Now, on to my favorite part.&#xA0;</span></span></p>
<h2>Even Androids Will Never Be Fulfilled</h2>
<p>If what Hurley and Dennett say is true, then (I think) this problem holds true&#xA0;<em>for all intelligent creatures</em>.</p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Even if you upgrade yourself into a cyborg, create an AI robot, or meet an alien from another planet, they&#x2019;re all&#xA0; going struggle with the same fundamental problem&#x2014;all of us are finite, limited creatures facing off against a world that is bigger, more complex, and impossible to predict.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Aliens will still cheat on their purple-skinned Alien spouses. Aliens will still eat too many bowls of Dippin&#x2019; Dots ice cream, and then fail miserably when they go on diets. Aliens will still gamble away their Space Credits at the nearest planetary casino.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Some movements like <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">transhumanism</a></span> think we can re-engineer the human organism in order to solve many of our most pressing problems.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">I&#x2019;m not as optimistic. Maybe we&#x2019;ll be able to come up with better solutions&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know. But I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ll ever find a cure-all. The problem of desire is something that can be&#xA0;<em>managed </em>but never cured.</span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true"><span class>Managing Tantalus</span></h2>
<p class>So how can we go about managing our desires?&#xA0; There are two ways, says Sedlacek:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;It would appear that there are two ways to be happy in consumption: to permanently escalate consumption (to reach the next unit of happiness, we need ever more consumption material) or to </em><span class>become aware</span><em> that we have enough.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">In other words, our options are to</span></p>
<ul class="ul-list" data-mark="*">
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class contenteditable="true"><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class><strong>(A) Increase consumption, forever and always into the future.</strong></span> Sedlacek calls this &#x201C;the hedonist program&#x201D;, for obvious reasons. It&#x2019;s a hedonic pursuit of more, more, more.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class contenteditable="true"><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class><strong>(B) Limit your desires.</strong></span> Sedlacek calls this &#x201C;the stoic program&#x201D;, after the therapeutic school of <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoic philosophy</a></span> that used various techniques to limit their desires.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>We&#x2019;ve already seen a little bit of why (A) isn&#x2019;t going to cut it.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Desires always grow faster than our possessions. Plus, the Earth has limited resources. Growing consumption isn&#x2019;t sustainable. There&#x2019;s only one earth and we&#x2019;re not getting another one anytime soon</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Our best bet, then, is to try our best to limit our desires.&#xA0;</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>What follows are some things that I find useful.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">First, just being aware helps. Now that I know more consumption may actually make things worse, I am hesitant to buy things. I shattered my phone a few months ago, but I still use it. I&#x2019;ve used the same $10 headphones for years and years. I&#x2019;m okay with <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://patreon.com/charleschu">an income</a></span><span class> that is &#x201C;below average&#x201D;&#x2014;more is nice, but I know it won&#x2019;t revolutionize my life.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Psychological tactics can help too. The philosophies of Stoicism, Buddhism, and Epicureanism are all good places to start. I like Seneca&#x2019;s <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://amzn.to/2NS9zOP">letters</a></span> and Montaigne&#x2019;s <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://amzn.to/2NP9tYg">essays</a></span><span class>, which I read a few pages from each night.</span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>You can also use &#x201C;environmental&#x201D; tactics. It&#x2019;s hard to desire things you don&#x2019;t know exist, so I try to keep myself ignorant of all the things I don&#x2019;t have.&#xA0;</span></span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>I live near Tokyo, but I try to avoid going to the city unless I have to. Everybody is too well-dressed, with shiny handbags and expensive haircuts. Plus, there are ads everywhere&#x2014;on the trains, on billboards, etc&#x2014;all announcing to me how much I don&#x2019;t have.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class="md-image md-img-loaded" contenteditable="false" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/1e/5f/a1/1e5fa1e53ebd409368c9b8e82d2dd7e0.jpg"><img class=" aligncenter jetpack-lazy-image" src="http://thepolymathproject.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/i.pinimg.com/564x/1e/5f/a1/1e5fa1e53ebd409368c9b8e82d2dd7e0.jpg?ssl=1"><noscript><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.pinimg.com/564x/1e/5f/a1/1e5fa1e53ebd409368c9b8e82d2dd7e0.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></span></span></p>
<p class><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>Choosing the right friends is important too. I avoid people who get a lot of self-esteem from achievement&#x2014;people who can&#x2019;t feel good unless they earn more than others or feel they are &#x201C;successful.&#x201D; Self-help has an ego problem.</span></span></p>
<p>But perhaps the most interesting thing you can do, says Sedlacek, is to &#x201C;redirect&#x201D; your desires. Our desire for more won&#x2019;t go away, but we can at least teach ourselves to desire the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">right things</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Insufficiency is inherent to man; it is our characteristic, which, according to the story of the Garden of Eden, existed even before the Fall&#x2026; But <span class><strong>we can influence what we begin to lack.</strong></span> And we should pay closer attention to what we choose.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p class>Lately, I&#x2019;m pretty obsessed with <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/podcast">figuring out how the world works</a>. Despite what Pandora has to say about it, I think boundless curiosity isn&#x2019;t too terrible of a vice to have.</p>
