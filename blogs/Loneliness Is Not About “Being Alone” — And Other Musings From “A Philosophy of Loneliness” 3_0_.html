					<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">One of you recommended that I read Lars Svendsen&#x2019;s <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://amzn.to/2PlVwCB"><em>A Philosophy of Loneliness</em></a></span>. I&#x2019;m a few months late, but I&#x2019;ve finally finished it.&#xA0;</span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><span class>As someone who spent most of his early life is a state of perpetual loneliness, there was a lot in this book to think about and relate to. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">What follows are a few musings on my favorite bits from the book.</span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">Loneliness is my friend</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">The first thing to understand is that&#x2014;in most cases&#x2014;loneliness is <span class><em>good</em></span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Humans have emotions for a reason. We experience &#x201C;bad&#x201D; emotions like anger, fear, or sadness because they help (or helped) us survive. Fear helps me run from angry lions. Anger helps me fight off enemies. </span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">When I was lonely, my loneliness pushed me to make friends. It encouraged me to talk to strangers on the street. Without loneliness, I guess I would still be lonely.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Emotions are usually good, but sometimes they go out of control. Sadness can turn into crippling depression. Anger can turn into abusive rage.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">A sign that loneliness has gone out of control is that you&#x2019;re <span class><em>always</em></span> lonely. </span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">If you&#x2019;re lonely for a few months after your beloved Grandmother Gretta passes away, that&#x2019;s normal. But if you&#x2019;ve been lonely every day for the past five years, something is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Svendsen calls this kind of loneliness <span class><strong>chronic loneliness</strong></span>.</span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">Alone in a crowd</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">So what leads to chronic loneliness?</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">You might think that <span class><em>being alone</em></span> leads to loneliness, but this is not the case, says Svendsen:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x2026;an average person spends almost 80 per cent of their waking hours together with others. That is also true of the lonely. &#x2026;[Lonely people] spend no more time alone than the group who answer that they do not feel lonely. Indeed, in a review of over four hundred essays devoted to the experience of loneliness, one researcher found no correlation at all between the degree of physical isolation and the intensity of the loneliness felt. As such, <span class><strong>the actual number of people by whom a person is surrounded is uncorrelated to the emotion of loneliness.</strong></span></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Some of my loneliest years were spent living in Tokyo&#x2014;a city with 10 million people. I was also pretty in lonely in high school, despite spending 8 hours a day every day with the same people.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">What this suggests is that loneliness is not just about <span class><em>aloneness</em></span>. </span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">Good ingredients; Bad chef</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">From the outside, lonely people look a lot like everyone else:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>Lonely people are no more or less physically attractive than the rest of the population, nor are they more or less intelligent. Their everyday activities are not different from those of the non-lonely.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">What&#x2019;s more, the chronically lonely people tend to <span class><em>stay</em></span> that way, no matter how life circumstances change:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>A person tested at a given time for their degree of loneliness will often score similarly on tests earlier or later in their life. Of course, changes in external circumstances influence loneliness, but <span class><strong>for many the degree of loneliness experienced remains quite stable, despite dramatic changes in life circumstances. </strong></span>This suggests that loneliness for these people depends more on individual disposition than on external circumstance.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">This counters the common belief that all you need to do to overcome loneliness is to find the right home city (San Francisco, no doubt), friend group, rock climbing club, or lover.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">This suggests that, for the pathologically lonely, loneliness comes from within:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>For many chronically lonely people &#x2026; the problem seems to be this: no matter what their social surroundings might be &#x2013; whether or not they are constantly surrounded by caring and thoughtful friends and family &#x2013; they still feel lonely. They harbour an expectation of attachment so strong that it can never be realized. No subsequent change in their social surroundings will be able to solve their loneliness problem.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Svendsen calls this <span class><strong>endogenous loneliness</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">You can have all the ingredients for carrot cake, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;ll be able to make one. You have to develop the skill of baking it.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Likewise, I guess you could say lonely people can have all the right &#x201C;ingredients&#x201D; to help overcome loneliness&#x2014;close friends, loving family, tight community, etc.&#x2014;but they may not have the right internal, psychological skills to bake their way out of their loneliness.</span></p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m on my ninth marriage because my last eight spouses sucked.&#x201D;</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">What does it mean to say that loneliness comes from within?</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Well, part of it is <span class><em>expectations</em></span>. Chronically lonely people are social perfectionists, says Svendsen: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;social perfectionism &#x2026; is more common among lonely individuals than non-lonely. The lonely person thinks that they are unloved and that no one will befriend them, but perhaps the problem is rather that, because they place such impossible demands on friendship and love, they are not capable of loving or befriending someone.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">It&#x2019;s common in self-help to define happiness with the following equation: HAPPINESS = EXPECTATIONS &#x2013; REALITY. That&#x2019;s way too simplistic, but there&#x2019;s a granule of truth there&#x2014;if your expectations are too high, nobody is good enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Where do these expectations come from? Svendsen seems to think they come, in part, from overly-idealistic stories of love and friendship:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Idealized stories about the nature of love lead us astray, and make it more difficult to realize that love that is most certainly real&#x2026; If you establish an ideal of love that no one will ever be able to meet, however, you thereby make it impossible to ever have your need for love satisfied.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of young people seem to have unrealistic expectations of love. It certainly doesn&#x2019;t look like it does in the movies, and I&#x2019;ve found that accepting you&#x2019;ll have bad days helps you appreciate the good ones more.</p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">Miss Independent = Miss Lonely</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">The most interesting&#x2014;and perhaps most significant&#x2014;thing about the the chronically lonely, though, is that <span class><em>they cannot trust others</em></span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">You can see this even on a national level. Countries with high levels of trust (Nordic countries) are lower in loneliness, while countries with low levels of trust (Greece, Italy, former Communist countries, etc.) are lonelier.&#xA0;</span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">This doesn&#x2019;t guarantee a cause-and-effect relationship, but it&#x2019;s interesting to think about.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">What is it about a lack of trust that might lead to loneliness? </span><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Well, a major source of meaning in life comes from being needed by others. And, to be needed by others, there needs to be a mutual relationship of trust and vulnerability.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Trusting people means <span class><em>being willing to be hurt</em></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;When you demonstrate trust in someone, you become vulnerable, and when you demonstrate trust regarding something or someone important to you, you become extremely vulnerable. If you confide in them, you lose control over that information. If you attempt to form ties to them, you run the risk of rejection.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Trust is a two-way street, and if you&#x2019;re not willing to trust others and risk a bit of pain and suffering for them, they&#x2019;re not going to trust or rely on you either.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">What&#x2019;s worse is that, when you get in the habit of <span class><em>not</em></span> trusting others, it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Fear and mistrust also become self-perpetuating. Mistrust fosters more mistrust, because, among other reasons, it isolates individuals from situations where they could have learned to trust others. Lonely people perceive their social surroundings as threatening to a greater extent than do non-lonely people, and this fear hinders the precise thing that could cause it to decrease: human contact.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">&#x201C;I only care about you because you make me feel nice.&#x201D;</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Now here&#x2019;s my favorite part from the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">For whatever reason, we need to care about others for them to care about us. And this is precisely what the chronically lonely cannot do:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;In conversations, lonely people tend to talk more about themselves and ask fewer questions. &#x2026; They seem to be difficult to get to know. They are also more self-centered than others. And yet, <span class><strong>self-absorbed individuals are utterly dependent on the gaze of others</strong></span>. It is only by occupying another person&#x2019;s field of view that they find confirmation of their existence. Nonetheless, lonely people do not have a true relationship to themselves or others. They meet themselves only in the reflection they see in others&#x2019; eyes. As such, other people become nothing more than a set of mirrors. &#x2026; Indeed, the individual reduces others first and foremost to the role of provider of such confirmation. Ultimately, <span class><strong>they are not actually interested in others &#x2013; and that is precisely the reason they are so lonely.</strong></span>&#x201C;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">I know people like this, and what disturbs me deeply is how they think of human relationships as a <span class><em>transaction</em></span>. Social time with others is a source of pleasure, or stimulation, or distraction but <span class><em>not as something valuable in itself</em></span>.</span></p>
<p>I wonder what makes people this way. Is it education? Is it childhood experiences? Is it genetics? Lars doesn&#x2019;t go much into this.</p>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading" contenteditable="true">Last words</h2>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">There&#x2019;s a lot more to think about in <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://amzn.to/2PlVwCB">the book</a></span>, and a suggest you read it yourself, especially if you suffer from loneliness or know somebody who does.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">From how I wrote this, it might sound like Svendsen is saying, &#x201C;Lonely people are self-absorbed, can&#x2019;t trust others, and have extreme expectations, so it&#x2019;s their fault that they&#x2019;re lonely.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">But that&#x2019;s not what I believe, and I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what Svendsen is saying. A large part of how you see the world is the result of things outside of your control. Half of loneliness is genetic, and another big part of it may be because <span class><a spellcheck="false" href="https://amzn.to/2MH0UC9">people taught you to think in the wrong way</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">Once you realize and admit, though, that loneliness also comes from <span class><em>within</em></span>, you can start to take the first steps towards changing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true">I end with this final quote from Svendsen:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="md-line md-end-block" contenteditable="true"><em>&#x201C;Only a person who can exhibit friendship and love can feel lonely. On the other hand, it is also reasonable to say that only a being with the capacity for loneliness can love or be someone&#x2019;s friend.&#x201D;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Though I don&#x2019;t ever want to go back to suffering from chronic loneliness, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s realistic to expect a life free from loneliness either. Loneliness comes in a package with love and friendship, and it&#x2019;s not going away as long as we hold those things valuable.</p>
