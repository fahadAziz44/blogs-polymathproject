					<p><em>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got more excuses than a pregnant nun.&#x201D;</em><i>&#xA0;-Ido Portal</i></p>
<p>The longer I live, the more I realize people are full of shit.</p>
<p>Can&#x2019;t get ahead in life?</p>
<p>Yes, it must be because the guy at your job interview was an absolute prick; because your genes failed the genetic roulette and you almost look like Benedict Cumberbatch except your nose is too big and now you can&#x2019;t be an actor; because that demon of a Bulgarian calculus teacher Mrs. Petkova didn&#x2019;t like the way you looked at her; because your parents were too nice to you growing up AND they didn&#x2019;t send you to the right school; because the your damned financial advisor told you that tech stocks could only go up and then the bubble burst&#x2026; Yes, that must be it.</p>
<p>No, of course you didn&#x2019;t fail your interview because you stayed up late too many nights chasing frat girl tail to actually learn any useful skills; of course your lackluster career has nothing to due with how you look like a pregnant horse every time you try to smile on camera; of course your lack of a nest egg has <em>nothing</em> to do with you not knowing the word &#x201C;asset allocation&#x201D;&#x2026;</p>
<p>No, of course it isn&#x2019;t because you didn&#x2019;t <em>try</em> or anything&#x2014;we wouldn&#x2019;t want to think <em>choices</em> actually played some role in life outcomes! That&#x2019;s too much responsibility! Hey, bring me my silver spoon!</p>
<p>Never taking responsibility for your life&#x2013;that&#x2019;s the loser&#x2019;s mindset.</p>
<p>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yes, life is random. And, yes, some end up with a better dice roll than others.</p>
<p>But this &#x201C;hands-in-the-air&#x201D; way of looking at the world is a bear trap. Why? Because, a lot of the time, <strong>the people that seem lucky are just working a hellofalot harder than you.</strong><br>
<strong><br>
</strong>The way a &#x201C;successful&#x201D; person runs a marathon or a business (smirk) may appear effortless, natural and &#x201C;inborn&#x201D;. But what we don&#x2019;t see is all the 16-hour days, hard high-altitude training in the mountains, weeks away from the family, and the fire of a life driven by complete <em>obsession</em> with what one does.</p>
<p>We only see the outside, and the outside looks superhuman.</p>
<p>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Below are two exercises I&#x2019;ve used to retake life control. This is old stuff; it comes straight from Stoic philosophy.</p>
<p>As many wise philosophers have said: Don&#x2019;t sweat the stuff you can&#x2019;t control. Sweat the stuff you can. (I believe that&#x2019;s a direct translation from the original Roman texts.)</p>
<p>Two exercises:</p>
<p><strong>Catch excuses and reframe.</strong><br>
Use a small notebook or your phone to write down every time you find yourself making an excuse. Reframe the excuse into an actionable point. (&#x201C;I&#x2019;m hot and life sucks.&#x201D; -&gt; &#x201C;Maybe I can slow my heart rate down with breathing exercises and it won&#x2019;t be so hot&#x2026;&#x201D;)</p>
<p><strong>Track your day. Reflect.</strong><br>
Spend an hour tracking everything you do in a single day. Every minute of it&#x2014;what you ate, where you shit, what people you met. Let it sit for a few days, then review it <em>as if you were looking at another person.</em> How in line is that person&#x2019;s behavior with their goals? Wait, do you even have goals? Oh god&#x2026; That&#x2019;s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>Frankly, most people (a) aren&#x2019;t operating at even 50% of their maximum potential and (b) don&#x2019;t know where they&#x2019;re going in life anyway.</p>
<p>Try out some of the exercises and spent (a lot) of time thinking what you want out of life. Or don&#x2019;t.</p>
