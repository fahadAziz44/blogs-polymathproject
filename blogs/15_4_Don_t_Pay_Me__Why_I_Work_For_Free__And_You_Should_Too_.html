					<p>When I saw Kevin&#x2019;s message, I did a little happy dance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m emailing you on behalf of the New York Observer&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The New York Observer gets 6 million readers a month. &#xA0;Kevin was emailing to ask &#xA0;if he could syndicate one of my pieces for publication..</p>
<p>Of course, I said yes.</p>
<p>My article hit the front page. That&#x2019;s my work on display in front of 6 million members of an educated readership.</p>
<p>But attention doesn&#x2019;t pay the bills. A freelance writer might make $300+ for such a piece. How much did they pay me?</p>
<p>Nothing. Nada. Zero.</p>
<p>Should I be outraged?</p>
<p>Nope. In fact, that&#x2019;s exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>If the Observer had offered me 10x the typical payment ($3000), I still would&#x2019;ve turned them down. I&#x2019;m here to play the long game. And in the game of writing, there&#x2019;s a lot more to winning than cold, hard cash.</p>
<h2>&#xA0;The Other Currencies</h2>
<p>Money isn&#x2019;t the only currency.</p>
<p>In exchange for forfeiting cash, writers get something much more valuable&#x2026;</p>
<p>They get <em>readership.</em></p>
<p>In exchange for my &#x201C;free labor&#x201D;, the Observer let me slip in a little somethin&#x2019; somethin&#x2019; at the end of my article&#x2026;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Charles publishes <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/theopencircle">The Open Circle</a>, a free weekly newsletter to 3000+ readers where he deconstructs high-achievers (like the Navy SEALs) and shares exclusive lessons from his own crazy experiments. <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/theopencircle">Join here.</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Say hello to the byline&#x2014;this little beauty is worth ten times any paycheck.</p>
<p>Readers who follow the links are whizzed away on a one-way ride back to my personal webpage&#x2026; That single article brought over 4000 new readers to my site.</p>
<p>Guess what new readers who already read something they like do when they arrive?</p>
<p><em>They join my tribe.</em></p>
<h2>Better Than Cash: The Value of a Tribe</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;ll take 4000 readers over $300 in cash any day.</p>
<p>Of those 4000 readers that visited from the Observer article, over 60% of them signed up for <a href="http://thepolymathproject.com/theopencircle">The Open Circle</a>, my free weekly newsletter. That&#x2019;s thousands of new eyes on the best content I produce each week.</p>
<p>Many of these readers go on to become a writer&#x2019;s most loyal audience. They&#x2019;ll share your work, give valuable feedback, buy anything you produce in the future and even drive hundreds of miles to come meet you in person.</p>
<p>Who <em>wouldn&#x2019;t</em> take that over $300 in cash?</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t think of my readers as dollar signs, but some big-wig marketers value each &#x201C;tribe member&#x201D; at as much as $1 a month. By those standards, those 2000+ signups I got for working &#x201C;for free&#x201D; are worth over $24,000 a year!</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s not the only benefit of a dedicated readership. Cultivating a tribe has a host of other benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A negotation lever with publishers for future book deals</li>
<li>A &#x201C;personal network&#x201D; that you can reach out to for help or collaborate with on future publications
<ul>
<li>Your tribe naturally attracts smart, like-minded thinkers. This can be the start of all sorts of future projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smoother pitching to other A-list bloggers and writers</li>
<li>A &#x201C;foot-in-the-door&#x201D; for features in other prestigious publications</li>
</ul>
<p>My recommendation to writers: <strong>put the money aside and obsess over your tribe instead.</strong> Once you have them, you&#x2019;ll never worry for money again.</p>
