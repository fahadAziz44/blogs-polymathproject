					<p>Meet Johnny, our average American.</p>
<p>Johnny is in debt, overweight and unhappy but blames it on his boss (and bad parenting); doesn&#x2019;t stretch his hip flexors; unlocks his smartphone 100+ times a day to check Instagram photos of his favorite Russian model; can count the books he read this year on one hand (at least he can count!); watches Netflix on the couch after work; sometimes goes to church on Sundays; couldn&#x2019;t identify a barbell if it bounced off a trampoline and hit him in the face; and has so much free time that he manages to sleep 6 hours some nights.</p>
<p>Regardless of what we might think, most of us are part-Johnny. Most of us are mostly-Johnny, even.</p>
<p>A scary yet obvious thing nobody is thinking about:<i> if you do what everyone else does, you are the definition of average.</i></p>
<p>And the corollary to that: to be the exception, the un-average person, you need to make &#x201C;un-average&#x201D; decisions.</p>
<p>Most humans are on autopilot, look to their peer group (or whoever happens to be famous on TV) for decisions, and make up reasons for doing what they can&#x2019;t explain (&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just who I am&#x201D;, &#x201C;It makes me happy&#x201D;, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve always done that&#x201D;, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s in my nature&#x201D;).</p>
<p>An easy predictor of somebody&#x2019;s future life: (a) whatever their life looked like last month and (b) whatever the life of their friends looks like.</p>
<p>Uncommon results come from uncommon action. If you take a peek around you and don&#x2019;t like what you see, get your ass off the couch, turn your brain off autopilot, and start making some changes people.</p>

<p><i>I&#x2019;m writing from China this week. I&#x2019;m swamped by weddings, relatives and the shoddy Chinese internet system, but I&#x2019;ll be posting whenever I can. Stay tuned!</i></p>
